Google also will host a physical installation of the visualization project in the Blue Zone at COP 28.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;NASA is the U.S. space agency that provides end-to-end research about our home planet, and it is our job to inform the world about what we learn,&rdquo; said Kate Calvin, NASA&rsquo;s chief scientist and senior climate advisor in Washington. &ldquo;Highlighting our Earth science data in the installation of &lsquo;A Passage of Water&rsquo; is a unique way to share information, in a digestible way, around the important connection between climate change and the Earth&rsquo;s water cycle.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For six decades, NASA has been collecting data on Earth&rsquo;s land, water, air, and climate. This data is used to inform decision-makers on ways to mitigate, adapt and respond to climate change. All of NASA&rsquo;s Earth science data is available for scientists and the public to access in a variety of ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;NASA studies our home planet and its interconnected systems more than any other planet in our universe,&rdquo; said Karen St. Germain, director of NASA&rsquo;s Earth Science Division. &ldquo;&lsquo;A Passage of Water&rsquo; provides an opportunity to highlight the public availability of SWOT data and other NASA Earth science data to tell meaningful stories, improve awareness, and help everyday people who have to make real decisions in their homes, businesses, and communities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A collaboration between NASA and the French space agency CNES (Centre National d&rsquo;&Eacute;tudes Spatiales), SWOT is measuring the height of <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/see-swot-missions-unprecedented-view-of-global-sea-levels\">nearly all water</a> on Earth&rsquo;s surface, providing one of the most detailed, comprehensive views yet of the planet&rsquo;s freshwater bodies. SWOT provides insights into how the ocean influences climate change and how a warming world affects lakes, rivers, and reservoirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<section class='newsletter_cta_module' style='background-color: #F2F6FF'>\n<div class='newsletter_cta_inner_wrapper'>\n<div class='module_title'>\nGet NASA's Climate Change News\n</div>\n<div class='email_field_container'>\n<form action='/newsletter_signup/' class='body_form'>\n<input class='email_field' name='newsletter_subscribe_email' placeholder='enter email address' type='email'>\n<button class='email_submit' onMouseOut='this.style.color='#396AA2'' onMouseOver='this.style.color='#48A1C0'' style='color: #396AA2'>\n<svg height=\"100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 26 20\" width=\"100%\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"m60.5879081 230.937543c.0854372-.049231.1936357-.033361.2609299.038219l8.1980135 8.67638c.0573979.060243.0725721.148018.038925.22316-.0329873.075791-.1088582.124698-.1929759.124698h-23.4714813c-.1398664 0-.2774236-.039191-.4199289-.121459-.0577278-.032713-.096323-.091013-.1035802-.156115s.0171534-.129556.0659747-.174253l9.163223-8.345364c.0672942-.061539.1679056-.072227.2477349-.027854l2.4130239 1.353538c.3239356.180731.7362774.179112 1.0582338-.006801zm9.098032-5.453759c.0654834-.037926.1449758-.039575.2101334-.001319.0645061.037595.1039265.107181.1039265.183032v11.396496c0 .087064-.0521261.164564-.1319443.196553-.0244341.009234-.0504971.014181-.0762344.014181-.0573388 0-.1120712-.023415-.1521431-.067277l-6.7568492-7.373077c-.0420266-.0465-.0615739-.110809-.0534292-.173799.009122-.063319.0465877-.119383.1006685-.151043zm-25.5752757-.001316c.0693403-.036687.1551402-.037331.2230798-.001287l7.6225345 4.000908c.0616359.032826.1036603.090432.1113648.15544.0077045.064687-.0185608.129695-.0710914.173785l-7.6207835 6.497291c-.0420244.036044-.0970064.055031-.1519884.055031-.0308179 0-.0612857-.005792-.0900024-.0177-.0812472-.032504-.1337778-.106523-.1337778-.187945v-10.497876c0-.073054.0420244-.140959.1106644-.177647zm25.0262707-5.482468c.4761039 0 .8630649.382512.8630649.852398v1.534382c0 .101048-.0864416.152071-.1701818.208431-.0692208.046689-.2535844.148069-.3231429.18642l-12.3732987 7.189022c-.0334285.019676-.0715844.029347-.1094026.029347-.0371428 0-.0742857-.008671-.1073766-.02768l-12.7589091-7.197692c-.0709091-.036684-.1576883-.127393-.1576883-.20643v-1.715467c0-.470219.386961-.852731.8630649-.852731z\" fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" transform=\"translate(-44 -220)\"/></svg>\n</button>\n</form>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The detail that SWOT is providing on the world&rsquo;s oceans and fresh water is game-changing.

These conditions can spread poleward along the western coasts of the Americas. El Ni&ntilde;o, which is still developing this year, can bring more rain than usual to the U.S. Southwest and drought to countries in the western Pacific like Indonesia. These impacts typically occur in January through March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NASA analysis finds that a strong El Ni&ntilde;o could result in up to five instances of a type of flooding called a 10-year flood event this winter in cities including Seattle and San Diego. Places like La Libertad and Baltra in Ecuador could get up to three of these 10-year flood events this winter. This type of flooding doesn&rsquo;t normally occur along the west coast of the Americas outside of El Ni&ntilde;o years. The researchers note that by the 2030s, rising seas and climate change could result in these cities experiencing similar numbers of 10-year floods annually, with no El Ni&ntilde;o required.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='/internal_resources/2740/sea_level_anomaly_data_from_SWOT.png' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMUNjQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e1a168be654909d2cc26f21b57829943da99aa03/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/sea_level_anomaly_data_from_SWOT.png?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='sea_level_anomaly_data_from_SWOT' src='/internal_resources/2740/sea_level_anomaly_data_from_SWOT.png' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nData from the SWOT satellite shows sea level anomalies &ndash; how much higher or lower sea levels are compared to the average height &ndash; off the coast of Ecuador and Peru on Aug. 12, 2023, and Oct. 3, 2023.

They&rsquo;re a measure of how high local sea levels become: The extent of flooding in a particular city or community depends on several factors, including a region&rsquo;s topography and the location of homes and infrastructure relative to the ocean. Ten-year floods can result in what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration classifies as moderate flooding, with some inundation of roads and buildings, and the possible need to evacuate people or move belongings to higher ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NASA&rsquo;s coastal flooding analysis finds that by the 2030s, during strong El Ni&ntilde;o years, cities on the west coast of the Americas could see up to 10 of these 10-year flood events. By the 2050s, strong El Ni&ntilde;os may result in as many as 40 instances of these events in a given year.</p>\r\n\r\n<section class='newsletter_cta_module' style='background-color: #F2F6FF'>\n<div class='newsletter_cta_inner_wrapper'>\n<div class='module_title'>\nGet NASA's Climate Change News\n</div>\n<div class='email_field_container'>\n<form action='/newsletter_signup/' class='body_form'>\n<input class='email_field' name='newsletter_subscribe_email' placeholder='enter email address' type='email'>\n<button class='email_submit' onMouseOut='this.style.color='#396AA2'' onMouseOver='this.style.color='#48A1C0'' style='color: #396AA2'>\n<svg height=\"100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 26 20\" width=\"100%\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"m60.5879081 230.937543c.0854372-.049231.1936357-.033361.2609299.038219l8.1980135 8.67638c.0573979.060243.0725721.148018.038925.22316-.0329873.075791-.1088582.124698-.1929759.124698h-23.4714813c-.1398664 0-.2774236-.039191-.4199289-.121459-.0577278-.032713-.096323-.091013-.1035802-.156115s.0171534-.129556.0659747-.174253l9.163223-8.345364c.0672942-.061539.1679056-.072227.2477349-.027854l2.4130239 1.353538c.3239356.180731.7362774.179112 1.0582338-.006801zm9.098032-5.453759c.0654834-.037926.1449758-.039575.2101334-.001319.0645061.037595.1039265.107181.1039265.183032v11.396496c0 .087064-.0521261.164564-.1319443.196553-.0244341.009234-.0504971.014181-.0762344.014181-.0573388 0-.1120712-.023415-.1521431-.067277l-6.7568492-7.373077c-.0420266-.0465-.0615739-.110809-.0534292-.173799.009122-.063319.0465877-.119383.1006685-.151043zm-25.5752757-.001316c.0693403-.036687.1551402-.037331.2230798-.001287l7.6225345 4.000908c.0616359.032826.1036603.090432.1113648.15544.0077045.064687-.0185608.129695-.0710914.173785l-7.6207835 6.497291c-.0420244.036044-.0970064.055031-.1519884.055031-.0308179 0-.0612857-.005792-.0900024-.0177-.0812472-.032504-.1337778-.106523-.1337778-.187945v-10.497876c0-.073054.0420244-.140959.1106644-.177647zm25.0262707-5.482468c.4761039 0 .8630649.382512.8630649.852398v1.534382c0 .101048-.0864416.152071-.1701818.208431-.0692208.046689-.2535844.148069-.3231429.18642l-12.3732987 7.189022c-.0334285.019676-.0715844.029347-.1094026.029347-.0371428 0-.0742857-.008671-.1073766-.02768l-12.7589091-7.197692c-.0709091-.036684-.1576883-.127393-.1576883-.20643v-1.715467c0-.470219.386961-.852731.8630649-.852731z\" fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" transform=\"translate(-44 -220)\"/></svg>\n</button>\n</form>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Watching Sea Levels Rise</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://sealevel.nasa.gov/understanding-sea-level/global-sea-level/thermal-expansion\">Water expands as it warms</a>, so sea levels tend to be higher in places with warmer water.

The potent greenhouse gas can originate from decomposing carbon stored in permafrost for thousands of years. Its release could accelerate climate warming and lead to more frequent wildfires in the tundra, where blazes have been historically rare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acf50b\">new study</a> was conducted by a team of scientists working as part of NASA&rsquo;s Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (<a href=\"https://above.nasa.gov/index.html?\">ABoVE</a>), a large-scale study of environmental change in Alaska and Western Canada. Researchers found that methane hot spots were roughly 29% more likely to occur in tundra that had been scorched by wildfire in the past 50 years compared to unburned areas. The correlation nearly tripled in areas where a fire burned to the edge of a lake, stream, or other standing-water body. The highest ratio of hot spots occurred in recently burned wetlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers first observed the methane hot spots using NASA&rsquo;s next-generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/airborne-visible-infrared-imaging-spectrometer-next-generation-aviris-ng\">AVIRIS-NG</a>) in 2017. Mounted on the belly of a research plane, the instrument has an optical sensor that records the interaction of sunlight with molecules near the land surface and in the air, and it has been used to measure and monitor hazards ranging from oil spills to <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-helps-spot-wine-grape-disease-from-skies-above-california\">crop disease</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='/internal_resources/2736/Photo_of_methane_bubbles.jpeg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBN1NiQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1ab6c2f1b26fc588f9e1ee20fd4b914003c0d78a/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/Photo_of_methane_bubbles.jpeg?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='Photo_of_methane_bubbles' src='/internal_resources/2736/Photo_of_methane_bubbles.jpeg' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nMethane bubbles pop on the surface of an Alaskan lake being studied by scientists with NASA&rsquo;s Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment.

Regionally, the number of hot spot detections in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta were anomalously high in 2018 surveys, but scientists didn&rsquo;t know what was driving their formation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Ice and Fire</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To help fill this gap, Elizabeth Yoseph, an intern at the time with the ABoVE campaign, focused on a methane-active region located in a wet and peaty area of the massive delta. Yoseph and the team used the AVIRIS-NG data to pinpoint hot spots across more than 687 square miles (1,780 square kilometers), then overlaid their findings on historical wildfire maps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What we uncovered is a very clear and strong relationship between fire history and the distribution of methane hot spots,&rdquo; said Yoseph, lead author of the new study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The connection arises from what happens when fire burns into the carbon-rich frozen soil, or permafrost, that underlies the tundra. Permafrost sequesters carbon from the atmosphere and can store it for tens of thousands of years. But when it thaws and breaks down in wet areas, flourishing microbes feed on and convert that old carbon to methane gas.

However, by some projections the fire risk in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta could quadruple by the end of the century due to warming conditions and increased lightning storms &ndash; the leading cause of tundra fires. Two of the <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/149973/alaska-ablaze\">largest tundra fires</a> on record in Alaska occurred in 2022, burning more than 380 square miles (100,000 hectares) of primarily tundra landscapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More research is needed to understand how a future of increasing blazes at high latitudes could impact the global climate. Arctic permafrost holds an estimated <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3153/thawing-permafrost-could-leach-microbes-chemicals-into-environment/\">1,700 billion metric tons</a> of carbon &ndash; roughly 51 times the amount of carbon the world released as fossil fuel emissions in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All that stored carbon also means that the carbon intensity of fire emissions from burning tundra is extremely high, said co-author Elizabeth Hoy, a fire researcher at NASA&rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. &ldquo;Tundra fires occur in areas that are remote and difficult to get to, and often can be understudied,&rdquo; she noted. &ldquo;Using satellites and airborne remote sensing is a really powerful way to better understand these phenomena.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scientists hope to continue exploring methane hot spots occurring throughout Alaska. Ground-based investigation is needed to better understand the links between fire, ice, and greenhouse gas emissions at the doorstep of the Arctic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study was published in the journal Environmental Research Letters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>News Media Contacts</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Jane J.

The data it collects will help researchers understand two key functions of both ecosystem types: the capture and the release of carbon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forests hold carbon in the wood of their trees; wetlands store it in their layers of organic soil. Disruption of either system, whether gradual or sudden, can accelerate the release of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. Tracking these land-cover changes on a global scale will help researchers study the impacts on the carbon cycle &ndash; the processes by which carbon moves between the atmosphere, land, ocean, and living things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The radar technology on NISAR will allow us to get a sweeping perspective of the planet in space and time,&rdquo; said Paul Rosen, the NISAR project scientist at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. &ldquo;It can give us a really reliable view of exactly how Earth&rsquo;s land and ice are changing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='/internal_resources/2728/NISAR_graphic.png' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBeENiQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e7a5e2d77ee6272a9742337fa7091749e5c2584a/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/NISAR_graphic.png?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='NISAR_graphic' src='/internal_resources/2728/NISAR_graphic.png' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nPictured in this artist&rsquo;s concept, NISAR, short for NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar, marks the first time the U.S. and Indian space agencies have cooperated on hardware development for an Earth-observing mission.

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Tracking Deforestation </b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Forestry and other land-use changes account for about 11% of net human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. NISAR&rsquo;s data will improve our understanding of how the loss of forests around the world influences the carbon cycle and contributes to global warming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Globally, we do not understand well the carbon sources and sinks from terrestrial ecosystems, particularly from forests,&rdquo; said Anup Das, an ecosystems scientist and co-lead of the ISRO NISAR science team. &ldquo;So we expect that NISAR will greatly help address that, especially in less dense forests, which are more vulnerable to deforestation and degradation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The signal from NISAR&rsquo;s L-band radar will penetrate the leaves and branches of forest canopies, bouncing off the tree trunks and the ground below. By analyzing the signal that reflects back, researchers will be able to estimate the density of forest cover in an area as small as a soccer field. With successive orbital passes, it will be able to track whether a section of forest has been thinned or cleared over time. The data &ndash; which will be collected in early morning and evening and in any weather &ndash; could also offer clues as to what caused the change, such as disease, human activity, or fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s an important set of capabilities for studying vast, often cloud-covered rainforests such as those in the Congo and Amazon basins, which lose millions of wooded acres every year. Fire releases carbon into the air directly, while the deterioration of forests reduces the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data could also help improve accounting of deforestation and forest degradation &ndash; as well as forest growth &ndash; as countries that rely on logging try to shift toward more sustainable practices, said Josef Kellndorfer, a member of the NISAR science team and founder of Earth Big Data LLC, a provider of large data sets and analytic tools for research and decisions support. &ldquo;Reducing deforestation and degradation is low-hanging fruit to address a substantial part of the global carbon emission problem,&rdquo; he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='/internal_resources/2729/NISAR_composite_image.jpeg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBeEdiQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--965167f7f441bcbc83a51d318d80dd59cb0ff2b0/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/NISAR_composite_image.jpeg?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='NISAR_composite_image' src='/internal_resources/2729/NISAR_composite_image.jpeg' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nTo show the kind of imagery NISAR will produce, researchers pointed to this composite that uses data from two Japanese L-band SAR missions to reveal land-cover change in Brazil&rsquo;s Xingu River basin between 1996 and 2007.

Through this natural process, wetlands are the planet&rsquo;s largest natural source of the potent greenhouse gas methane, which bubbles to the water&rsquo;s surface and travels into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, when wetlands dry out, the carbon they store is exposed to oxygen, releasing carbon dioxide.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='/internal_resources/2730/NISAR_airborne_radar_image.png' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBeEtiQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6bd14b668759f21d896befeb49d48a9f11d3d301/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/NISAR_airborne_radar_image.png?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='NISAR_airborne_radar_image' src='/internal_resources/2730/NISAR_airborne_radar_image.png' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nNISAR will track wetland flooding to study how these carbon-rich ecosystems are reacting to climate change.

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;These are huge reservoirs of carbon that can be released in a relatively short time frame,&rdquo; said Erika Podest, a NISAR science team member and a carbon cycle and ecosystems researcher at JPL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Less well understood is how changing temperature and precipitation patterns due to climate change &ndash; along with human activities such as development and agriculture &ndash; are affecting the extent, frequency, and duration of flooding in wetlands. NISAR will be able to monitor flooding, and with repeated passes, researchers will be able to track seasonal and annual variations in wetlands inundation, as well as long-term trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By coupling NISAR&rsquo;s wetlands observations with separate data on the release of greenhouse gases, researchers should gain insights that inform the management of wetland ecosystems, said Bruce Chapman, a NISAR science team member and JPL wetlands researcher. &ldquo;We have to be careful to reduce our impact on wetland areas so that we don&rsquo;t worsen the situation with the climate,&rdquo; he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NISAR is set to launch in early 2024 from southern India. In addition to tracking ecosystem changes, it will collect information on the motion of the land, helping researchers understand the dynamics of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and subsidence and uplift (when the surface sinks and rises). It will also track the movements and melting of both glaciers and sea ice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>More About the Mission</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>NISAR is an equal collaboration between NASA and ISRO and marks the first time the two agencies have cooperated on hardware development for an Earth-observing mission.

Their impacts vary widely, and satellites like the U.S.-European <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/5-things-to-know-about-sentinel-6-michael-freilich\">Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich</a> help anticipate those impacts on a global scale by tracking changes in sea surface height in the Pacific Ocean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://sealevel.nasa.gov/understanding-sea-level/global-sea-level/thermal-expansion\">Water expands as it warms</a>, so sea levels tend to be higher in places with warmer water. El Ni&ntilde;os are characterized by higher-than-normal sea levels and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures along the equatorial Pacific. These conditions can then propagate poleward along the western coasts of the Americas. El Ni&ntilde;os can bring wetter conditions to the U.S. Southwest and drought to regions in the western Pacific, including Indonesia. This year&rsquo;s El Ni&ntilde;o is still developing, but researchers are looking to the recent past for clues as to how it is shaping up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been two extreme El Ni&ntilde;o events in the past 30 years: the first from 1997 to 1998 and the second from 2015 to 2016. Both caused shifts in global air and ocean temperatures, atmospheric wind and rainfall patterns, and sea level. The maps above show sea levels in the Pacific Ocean during early October of 1997, 2015, and 2023, with higher-than-average ocean heights in red and white, and lower-than-average heights in blue and purple. Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich captured the 2023 data, the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite collected data for the 1997 image, and Jason-2 gathered data for the 2015 map.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By October 1997 and 2015, large areas of the central and eastern Pacific had sea levels more than 7 inches (18 centimeters) higher than normal. This year, sea levels are about 2 or 3 inches (5 to 8 centimeters) higher than average and over a smaller area compared to the 1997 and 2015 events. Both of the past El Ni&ntilde;os reached peak strength in late November or early December, so this year&rsquo;s event may still intensify.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Every El Ni&ntilde;o is a little bit different,&rdquo; said Josh Willis, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich project scientist at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. &ldquo;This one seems modest compared to the big events, but it could still give us a wet winter here in the Southwest U.S. if conditions are right.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>More About the Mission</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched in November 2020, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich is named after former NASA Earth Science Division Director Michael Freilich. The satellite is one of two that compose the Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS (Continuity of Service) mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sentinel-6/Jason-CS was jointly developed by ESA (European Space Agency), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), NASA, and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with funding support from the European Commission and technical support on performance from the French space agency CNES (Centre National d&rsquo;&Eacute;tudes Spatiales).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, visit:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sentinel-6\">https://www.nasa.gov/sentinel-6</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>News Media Contacts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Jane J.

About 24,000 years ago, a huge ice sheet spread across most of New England, and a wall of ice more than a mile high covered what is today Albany in upstate New York. Earth&rsquo;s mantle, somewhat like a flexed mattress, has been slowly readjusting ever since.

Using the radars on the ESA (European Space Agency) Sentinel-1 satellites, along with advanced data processing techniques, they mapped the motion in detail and pinpointed neighborhoods and landmarks &ndash; down to an airport runway and tennis stadium &ndash; that are subsiding more rapidly than the average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve produced such a detailed map of vertical land motion in the New York City area that there are features popping out that haven&rsquo;t been noticed before,&rdquo; said lead author Brett Buzzanga, a postdoctoral researcher at JPL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David Bekaert, a JPL scientist and lead investigator of the project, said that tracking local elevation changes and <a href=\"https://vesl.jpl.nasa.gov/sea-level/slr-gravity/\">relative sea level</a> can be important for flood mapping and planning purposes. This is especially critical as Earth&rsquo;s changing climate pushes oceans higher around the world, leading to more frequent <a href=\"https://sealevel.nasa.gov/news/262/nasa-project-shows-hidden-factors-shape-minor-coastal-floods/\">nuisance flood</a> events and exacerbating destructive storm surges.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Local Changes</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The team identified two notable hot spots of subsidence co-located with landfills in Queens. One, runway 13/31 at LaGuardia Airport, is subsiding at a rate of about 0.15 inches (3.7 millimeters) per year. The scientists noted that the airport is undergoing an $8 billion renovation designed in part to alleviate flooding from the rising waters of the Atlantic Ocean. They also identified Arthur Ashe Stadium, which is sinking at a rate of about 0.18 inches (4.6 millimeters) per year and required construction of a lightweight roof during renovation to reduce its heaviness and amount of subsidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='/internal_resources/2721/Data_images_of_subsidence_hotspots.jpeg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBeTZYQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4b391951b1bbfbdcdf74eb9485d21ef2442073b9/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/Data_images_of_subsidence_hotspots.jpeg?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='Data_images_of_subsidence_hotspots' src='/internal_resources/2721/Data_images_of_subsidence_hotspots.jpeg' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nThe team pinpointed hot spots: left, runway 13/31 at LaGuardia Airport in Queens, is subsiding at a rate of about 0.15 inches (3.7 millimeters) per year; right, part of Newtown Creek, a Superfund site in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is rising unevenly by about 0.06 inches (1.6 millimeters) per year. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Rutgers University\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Other subsidence hot spots include the southern portion of Governors Island &ndash; built on 38 million square feet (3.5 million cubic meters) of rocks and dirt from early 20th century subway excavations &ndash; as well as sites near the ocean in Brooklyn&rsquo;s Coney Island and Arverne by the Sea in Queens that were built on artificial fill. Similar levels of subsidence were observed beneath Route 440 and Interstate 78 in suburban New Jersey, which traverse historic fill locations, and in Rikers Island, expanded to its present size by landfilling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scientists also found previously unidentified uplift in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn &ndash; rising by about 0.06 inches (1.6 millimeters) per year &ndash; and in Woodside, Queens, which rose 0.27 inches (6.9 millimeters) per year between 2016 and 2019 before stabilizing. Co-author Robert Kopp of Rutgers University said that groundwater pumping and injection wells used to treat polluted water may have played a role, but further investigation is needed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m intrigued by the potential of using high-resolution InSAR to measure these kinds of relatively short-lived environmental modifications associated with uplift,&rdquo; Kopp said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scientists said that cities like New York, which are investing in coastal defenses and infrastructure in the face of sea level rise, can benefit from high-resolution estimates of land motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The JPL-led <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera\">OPERA</a> (Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis) project will detail surface displacement across North America in a future data product. To do that, it will leverage InSAR data from ESA&rsquo;s Sentinel-1 and from the upcoming <a href=\"https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/\">NISAR</a> (NASA-Indian Space Research Organization Synthetic Aperture Radar) mission, set to launch in 2024.

Meanwhile, Antarctic sea ice reached its lowest maximum extent on record on Sept. 10 at a time when the ice cover should have been growing at a much faster pace during the darkest and coldest months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientists track the seasonal and annual fluctuations because sea ice shapes Earth&rsquo;s polar ecosystems and plays a significant role in global climate. Researchers at NSIDC and NASA use satellites to measure sea ice as it melts and refreezes. They track sea ice extent, which is defined as the total area of the ocean in which the ice cover fraction is at least 15%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between March and September 2023, the ice cover in the Arctic shrank from a peak area of 5.64 million square miles (14.62 million square kilometers) to 1.63 million square miles (4.23 million square kilometers). That&rsquo;s roughly 770,000 square miles (1.99 million square kilometers) below the 1981&ndash;2010 average minimum of 2.4 million square miles (6.22 million square kilometers). The amount of sea ice lost was enough to cover the entire continental United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<section class='newsletter_cta_module' style='background-color: #F2F6FF'>\n<div class='newsletter_cta_inner_wrapper'>\n<div class='module_title'>\nGet NASA's Climate Change News\n</div>\n<div class='email_field_container'>\n<form action='/newsletter_signup/' class='body_form'>\n<input class='email_field' name='newsletter_subscribe_email' placeholder='enter email address' type='email'>\n<button class='email_submit' onMouseOut='this.style.color='#396AA2'' onMouseOver='this.style.color='#48A1C0'' style='color: #396AA2'>\n<svg height=\"100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 26 20\" width=\"100%\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"m60.5879081 230.937543c.0854372-.049231.1936357-.033361.2609299.038219l8.1980135 8.67638c.0573979.060243.0725721.148018.038925.22316-.0329873.075791-.1088582.124698-.1929759.124698h-23.4714813c-.1398664 0-.2774236-.039191-.4199289-.121459-.0577278-.032713-.096323-.091013-.1035802-.156115s.0171534-.129556.0659747-.174253l9.163223-8.345364c.0672942-.061539.1679056-.072227.2477349-.027854l2.4130239 1.353538c.3239356.180731.7362774.179112 1.0582338-.006801zm9.098032-5.453759c.0654834-.037926.1449758-.039575.2101334-.001319.0645061.037595.1039265.107181.1039265.183032v11.396496c0 .087064-.0521261.164564-.1319443.196553-.0244341.009234-.0504971.014181-.0762344.014181-.0573388 0-.1120712-.023415-.1521431-.067277l-6.7568492-7.373077c-.0420266-.0465-.0615739-.110809-.0534292-.173799.009122-.063319.0465877-.119383.1006685-.151043zm-25.5752757-.001316c.0693403-.036687.1551402-.037331.2230798-.001287l7.6225345 4.000908c.0616359.032826.1036603.090432.1113648.15544.0077045.064687-.0185608.129695-.0710914.173785l-7.6207835 6.497291c-.0420244.036044-.0970064.055031-.1519884.055031-.0308179 0-.0612857-.005792-.0900024-.0177-.0812472-.032504-.1337778-.106523-.1337778-.187945v-10.497876c0-.073054.0420244-.140959.1106644-.177647zm25.0262707-5.482468c.4761039 0 .8630649.382512.8630649.852398v1.534382c0 .101048-.0864416.152071-.1701818.208431-.0692208.046689-.2535844.148069-.3231429.18642l-12.3732987 7.189022c-.0334285.019676-.0715844.029347-.1094026.029347-.0371428 0-.0742857-.008671-.1073766-.02768l-12.7589091-7.197692c-.0709091-.036684-.1576883-.127393-.1576883-.20643v-1.715467c0-.470219.386961-.852731.8630649-.852731z\" fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" transform=\"translate(-44 -220)\"/></svg>\n</button>\n</form>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\r\n\r\n<p>Sea ice around Antarctica reached its lowest winter maximum extent on Sept. 10, 2023, at 6.5 million square miles (16.96 million square kilometers). That&rsquo;s 398,000 square miles (1.03 million square kilometers) below the previous record-low reached in 1986 &ndash; a difference that equates to roughly the size of Texas and California combined.

There also seems to be a lot more loose, lower concentration ice &ndash; even toward the North Pole &ndash; and areas that used to be pretty compact, solid sheets of ice through the summer. That&rsquo;s been happening more frequently in recent years.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<figure class='embedded_video video_player_container center'>\n<div class='video_wrapper'>\n<iframe title=\"Arctic Sea Ice Hits Annual Minimum, Antarctic Sets New Record\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/nPAuEFZ2Rqw?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\nArctic sea ice was the sixth lowest on record in 2023, while Antarctic sea ice set a new record for lowest maximum extent.

Since the start of the satellite record for ice in 1979, sea ice has not only been declining in the Arctic, but also getting younger. Earlier starts to spring melting and ever-later starts to autumn freeze-up are leading to <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147746/the-long-decline-of-arctic-sea-ice\">longer melting seasons</a>. Research has shown that, averaged across the entire Arctic Ocean, freeze-up is happening about a week later per decade, or one month later than in 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nathan Kurtz, lab chief of NASA&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/earth/cryosphere/\">Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory</a> at the agency&rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said that as the Arctic warms about four times faster than the rest of the planet, the ice is also growing thinner. &ldquo;Thickness at the end of the growth season largely determines the survivability of sea ice. New research is using satellites like NASA&rsquo;s ICESat-2 (<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/about-icesat-2\">Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2</a>) to monitor how thick the ice is year-round.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kurtz said that long-term measurements of sea ice are critical to studying what&rsquo;s happening in real time at the poles. &ldquo;At NASA we&rsquo;re interested in taking cutting-edge measurements, but we&rsquo;re also trying to connect them to the historical record to better understand what&rsquo;s driving some of these changes that we&rsquo;re seeing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientists are working to understand the cause of the meager growth of the Antarctic sea ice, which could include a combination of factors such as El Nino, wind patterns, and warming ocean temperatures. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00961-9\">New research</a> has shown that ocean heat is likely playing an important role in slowing cold season ice growth and enhancing warm season melting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This record-low extent <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151692/exceptionally-low-antarctic-sea-ice\">so far in 2023</a> is a continuation of a downward trend in Antarctic sea ice that started after a record high in 2014. Prior to 2014, ice surrounding the continent was increasing slightly by about 1% per decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sea ice melting at both poles reinforces warming because of a cycle called &ldquo;ice-albedo feedback.&rdquo; While bright sea ice reflects most of the Sun&rsquo;s energy back to space, open ocean water absorbs 90% of it. With greater areas of the ocean exposed to solar energy, more heat can be absorbed, which warms the ocean waters and further delays sea ice growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>News Media Contact</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Aries Keck <br />\r\nNASA Headquarters<br />\r\n<a class=\"fui-Link ___1eya986 f3rmtva f1ewtqcl fyind8e f1k6fduh f1w7gpdv fk6fouc fjoy568 figsok6 f1hu3pq6 f11qmguv f19f4twv f1tyq0we f1g0x7ka fhxju0i f1qch9an f1cnd47f fqv5qza f1vmzxwi f1o700av f13mvf36 f1cmlufx f9n3di6 f1ids18y f1tx3yz7 f1deo86v f1eh06m1 f1iescvh fhgqx19 f1olyrje f1p93eir f1nev41a f1h8hb77 f1x7u7e9 f10aw75t fsle3fq f17ae5zn\" href=\"mailto:Aries.Keck@nasa.gov\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"mailto:aries.keck@nasa.gov\">Aries.Keck@nasa.gov</a></p>\r\n",

Scientific observations and analyses made over decades by NASA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and other international institutions have shown this warming has been driven primarily by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, natural El Ni&ntilde;o events in the Pacific pump extra warmth into the global atmosphere and often correlate with the warmest years on record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;With background warming and marine heat waves that have been creeping up on us for decades, this El Ni&ntilde;o shot us over the hump for setting all kinds of records,&rdquo; Willis said. &ldquo;The heat waves that we experience now are longer, they&rsquo;re hotter, and they&rsquo;re more punishing. The atmosphere can also hold more water now, and when it&rsquo;s hot and humid, it&rsquo;s even harder for the human body to regulate its temperature.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Willis and other scientists expect to see the biggest impacts of El Ni&ntilde;o in February, March, and April 2024. El Ni&ntilde;o is associated with the weakening of easterly trade winds and the movement of warm water from the western Pacific toward the western coast of the Americas. The phenomenon can have widespread effects, often bringing cooler, wetter conditions to the U.S. Southwest and drought to countries in the western Pacific, such as Indonesia and Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, climate change is happening. Things that we said would come to pass are coming to pass,&rdquo; said Gavin Schmidt, climate scientist and director of GISS. &ldquo;And it will get worse if we continue to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into our atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NASA&rsquo;s full <a href=\"https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/\">temperature data set</a> and the complete methodology used for the temperature calculation and its uncertainties are available online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GISS is a NASA laboratory managed by the Earth Sciences Division of the agency&rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

In the 20th century, most heat waves in L.A. were dry. However, humid events have steadily increased in frequency and intensity since 1950 due in part to swelling moisture from the warming sea surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their case study, JPL scientists compared two heat waves that affected the Greater Los Angeles area in the summer of 2020: a prolonged muggy stretch in August and an extremely dry three-day spike in September. During the latter event, record-breaking temperatures soared over 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in the San Fernando Valley &ndash; a densely populated portion of the city of Los Angeles &ndash; while scorching winds fanned a destructive wildfire in the nearby San Gabriel Mountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For their study, <a href=\"http://ttps://doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-22-0149.1\">recently published</a> in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, the scientists used NASA&rsquo;s Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) data set &ndash; a reanalysis of historical atmospheric observations. They found that both heat waves drove temperatures above the 90th percentile for the August-September climate record in L.A. Using advanced weather modeling, they simulated the heat waves and looked at their impacts across the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers found that, although air temperatures were as much as 18 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) cooler during the muggy August heat wave, the <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/explore/ask-nasa-climate/3151/too-hot-to-handle-how-climate-change-may-make-some-places-too-hot-to-live/\">heat stress</a> to human health was more intense than the September event. That&rsquo;s because the <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/explore/ask-nasa-climate/3151/too-hot-to-handle-how-climate-change-may-make-some-places-too-hot-to-live/#:~:text=Raymond%20says%20the%20highest%20wet,Fahrenheit%20(35%20degrees%20Celsius).\">wet-bulb temperature</a> &ndash; which relates heat to how well our bodies cool down by sweating &ndash; surged due to the humidity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results underscore the importance of including humid heat when issuing extreme heat warnings, the scientists said.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Local Impacts</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Another key finding of the study was that heat waves don&rsquo;t touch every place the same way. &ldquo;The same heat wave can feel different because of local climate variabilities and disparities in vegetation, which has a shading and cooling effect. These small-scale variabilities make a big difference in impact,&rdquo; said Shreevastava, who studies extreme heat and its effect on urban and natural ecosystems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shreevastava and her team examined three regions that experienced the 2020 heat waves differently: Southern L.A. County and Orange County stayed cooler, given their proximity to the Pacific Ocean and coastal moisture. Valley regions, including San Fernando and Riverside, skewed drier and hotter. And central L.A. fell between the two extremes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the microclimate variations, humidity had a leveling effect: Both the coastal and inland areas experienced increased nighttime heat stress during the muggy August heat wave. This was a notable change for the valley regions, which historically have countered scorching daytime temperatures with drier nights. Valley areas such as those in San Bernardino and Riverside counties experienced the greatest change over recent historical averages, with up to 10.8 degrees Fahrenheit (6 degrees Celsius) of added heat stress during humid heat wave nights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers said that their findings highlight how disparities in small-scale heat wave patterns across urban neighborhoods are vitally important when designing emergency plans and policies for our shared, hotter future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>News Media Contacts</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Jane J.

Overall, extreme heat this summer put tens of millions of people under heat warnings and was linked to hundreds of heat-related illnesses and deaths. The record-breaking July continues a long-term trend of human-driven warming driven primarily by greenhouse gas emissions that has become evident over the past four decades.

Alarming warming around the world is driven primarily by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. And that rise in average temperatures is fueling dangerous extreme heat that people are experiencing here at home and worldwide.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>High sea surface temperatures contributed to July&rsquo;s record warmth. NASA&rsquo;s analysis shows especially warm ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific, evidence of the El Ni&ntilde;o that began developing in May 2023. Phenomena such as El Ni&ntilde;o or La Ni&ntilde;a, which warm or cool the tropical Pacific Ocean, can contribute a small amount of year-to-year variability in global temperatures. But these contributions are not typically felt when El Ni&ntilde;o starts developing in Northern Hemisphere summer. NASA expects to see the biggest impacts of El Ni&ntilde;o in February, March, and April 2024.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on NASA&rsquo;s global temperature record, visit:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/2023/climate-media-resources\"><b>https://www.nasa.gov/feature/2023/climate-media-resources</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>News Media Contacts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Jackie McGuinness / Katherine Rohloff<br />\r\nHeadquarters, Washington<br />\r\n202-358-1600<br />\r\n<a href=\"mailto:jackie.mcguinness@nasa.gov\">jackie.mcguinness@nasa.gov</a> / <a href=\"mailto:katherine.a.rohloff@nasa.gov\">katherine.a.rohloff@nasa.gov</a> </p>\r\n",

This is according to a NASA-led <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022EF003330\">study</a> that analyzed the projected impacts of such warming to understand how different climate effects might combine. A 2-degree rise in global temperatures is <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2865/a-degree-of-concern-why-global-temperatures-matter/\">considered a critical threshold</a> above which dangerous and cascading effects of human-generated climate change will occur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers found that more than a quarter of the world&rsquo;s population could experience an additional month of severe heat stress each year compared to the middle of the 20th century (1950-1979). High temperatures and drought could combine dangerously in places like the Amazon, increasing the risk of wildfire. In the American West, extreme fire weather will likely be more intense and last longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To investigate potentially compounding effects of rising temperatures, the study&rsquo;s authors worked with a specially processed set of climate predictions. The predictions were originally generated by 35 of the world&rsquo;s leading climate models &ndash; specifically, contributors to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), which includes <a href=\"https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/news-events/nccs-highlights/GISS-CMIP6\">models developed by the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies</a>. CMIP provides climate projections that help the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other international and national climate groups understand historical, current, and future climate changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<section class='newsletter_cta_module' style='background-color: #F2F6FF'>\n<div class='newsletter_cta_inner_wrapper'>\n<div class='module_title'>\nGet NASA's Climate Change News\n</div>\n<div class='email_field_container'>\n<form action='/newsletter_signup/' class='body_form'>\n<input class='email_field' name='newsletter_subscribe_email' placeholder='enter email address' type='email'>\n<button class='email_submit' onMouseOut='this.style.color='#396AA2'' onMouseOver='this.style.color='#48A1C0'' style='color: #396AA2'>\n<svg height=\"100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 26 20\" width=\"100%\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"m60.5879081 230.937543c.0854372-.049231.1936357-.033361.2609299.038219l8.1980135 8.67638c.0573979.060243.0725721.148018.038925.22316-.0329873.075791-.1088582.124698-.1929759.124698h-23.4714813c-.1398664 0-.2774236-.039191-.4199289-.121459-.0577278-.032713-.096323-.091013-.1035802-.156115s.0171534-.129556.0659747-.174253l9.163223-8.345364c.0672942-.061539.1679056-.072227.2477349-.027854l2.4130239 1.353538c.3239356.180731.7362774.179112 1.0582338-.006801zm9.098032-5.453759c.0654834-.037926.1449758-.039575.2101334-.001319.0645061.037595.1039265.107181.1039265.183032v11.396496c0 .087064-.0521261.164564-.1319443.196553-.0244341.009234-.0504971.014181-.0762344.014181-.0573388 0-.1120712-.023415-.1521431-.067277l-6.7568492-7.373077c-.0420266-.0465-.0615739-.110809-.0534292-.173799.009122-.063319.0465877-.119383.1006685-.151043zm-25.5752757-.001316c.0693403-.036687.1551402-.037331.2230798-.001287l7.6225345 4.000908c.0616359.032826.1036603.090432.1113648.15544.0077045.064687-.0185608.129695-.0710914.173785l-7.6207835 6.497291c-.0420244.036044-.0970064.055031-.1519884.055031-.0308179 0-.0612857-.005792-.0900024-.0177-.0812472-.032504-.1337778-.106523-.1337778-.187945v-10.497876c0-.073054.0420244-.140959.1106644-.177647zm25.0262707-5.482468c.4761039 0 .8630649.382512.8630649.852398v1.534382c0 .101048-.0864416.152071-.1701818.208431-.0692208.046689-.2535844.148069-.3231429.18642l-12.3732987 7.189022c-.0334285.019676-.0715844.029347-.1094026.029347-.0371428 0-.0742857-.008671-.1073766-.02768l-12.7589091-7.197692c-.0709091-.036684-.1576883-.127393-.1576883-.20643v-1.715467c0-.470219.386961-.852731.8630649-.852731z\" fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" transform=\"translate(-44 -220)\"/></svg>\n</button>\n</form>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers at the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) then took the output from CMIP6 models and used advanced statistical techniques to &ldquo;downscale&rdquo; them, improving the resolution significantly. NEX uses supercomputers at NASA&rsquo;s Ames Research Center in California&rsquo;s Silicon Valley to analyze vast amounts of data collected by aircraft and satellites or, in this case, projections produced by climate models. The resulting NEX dataset supporting this research is available to the public and can be <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/nex/gddp\">found online</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Combining Climate Impacts</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With the new dataset in hand, NEX researchers at Ames analyzed the downscaled projections to assess the changes predicted for six key climate variables. They examined changes in air temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, short- and longwave solar radiation, and wind speed at a point when warming passes 2&deg;C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We wanted to study how these aspects of the environment are projected to change and what their combined impacts could mean for people around the world,&rdquo; said Taejin Park, first author on the paper and a researcher at Ames with the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute (BAERI). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers paid special attention to two climate indicators: heat stress &ndash; or the combined effects of temperature and humidity on the human body &ndash; and fire weather &ndash; which considers temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind. Most regions of the world will experience higher heat stress, they found, while countries closer to the equator will suffer from a greater number of days considered extreme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The escalating impacts of all the climate extremes studied could cause significant damage to communities and economies, from fires, floods, landslides, and crop failures that may result,&rdquo; said Ramakrishna Nemani, senior scientist at BAERI and co-author of the study.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Democratizing Climate Data</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/nex/gddp\">NEX downscaled dataset</a> used for this research provides global, daily climate projections, derived from CMIP6 climate models<b>,</b> out to the year 2100. The day-to-day nature of the NEX product is important for capturing the extremes. If merged into a monthly average, Park explained, a few days projected to be dangerously hot and humid could get lost in the numbers, concealing the risk for human lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The level of local and regional detail &ndash; the resolution of the projections &ndash; is higher in the NEX product than most climate projections, which could help leaders develop targeted climate adaptation and mitigation plans. Raw climate model projections typically give results for areas of about 120 by 120 miles (200 by 200 kilometers), while the NEX  downscaling work increases that resolution to about 15 by 15 miles (25 by 25 kilometers).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Downscaling this much data is a big job, and NEX researchers relied on NASA&rsquo;s powerful Pleiades <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/ames/6-things-to-know-about-supercomputing-at-nasa\">supercomputer</a> at Ames. Pleiades helps solve some of NASA&rsquo;s most challenging problems, playing an important role in rocket launches for the Artemis program, fuel-efficient aircraft designs, and studies of Earth&rsquo;s climate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NEX scientists hope that the downscaled climate projections could help decision-makers prepare for and protect their regions against climate impacts. For example,a local policymaker could decide to build more flood barriers or pursue less development in flood-prone areas, said Ian Brosnan, co-author of the paper and principal scientist at NEX.The NEX dataset can also help new commercial and non-profit enterprises develop customized climate-risk assessments for the private and public sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The downscaled NASA data is in really accessible form,&rdquo; Brosnan said. &ldquo;People everywhere with some technical ability &ndash; from undergraduate students to experienced climate scientists &ndash; can dig into the information these projections contain.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Learn more:</b></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2878/a-degree-of-concern-why-global-temperatures-matter/\">A Degree of Concern: Why Global Temperatures Matter</a>, a two-part series. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>For researchers:</b></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2022EF003330\">What does global land climate look like at 2 degrees warming?</a>&rdquo;, published in the journal Earth&rsquo;s Future.</li>\r\n\t<li>Data description paper for the NEX-GDDP dataset: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01393-4\">NASA Global Daily Downscaled Projections, CMIP6</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>For news media: </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Animated map visuals showing projected change in the fire weather index are available in GIF and MP4 file formats for the following regions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>full Earth</li>\r\n\t<li>western United States</li>\r\n\t<li>sub-Saharan Africa</li>\r\n\t<li>the Amazon region</li>\r\n\t<li>Australia</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of the news media interested in covering these topics should reach out to the <a href=\"mailto:arc-dl-newsroom@mail.nasa.gov\">NASA </a><a href=\"mailto:arc-dl-newsroom@mail.nasa.gov\" target=\"_blank\">Ames newsroom</a>. </p>\r\n",

For the ocean, teams looked at sea surface height.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been installing instruments called water level loggers that measure how water levels go up and down,&rdquo; said Tamlin Pavelsky, the NASA freshwater science lead for SWOT at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Pavelsky directed teams that went to New Zealand&rsquo;s Waimakariri River and the Yukon River in Alaska.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, teams sampled freshwater bodies in Connecticut, Canada, and France, among other locations. They wanted to survey the types of lakes and rivers they expect SWOT to measure, and to sample freshwater bodies in areas that intersect with the satellite&rsquo;s orbit to compare measurements from the ground and from space.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='/internal_resources/2698/Image_of_a_satellite_in_a_mostly_white_room.jpeg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBOEdOQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--cea815b5f3206d2174061ce937eccb77c96b5d59/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/Image_of_a_satellite_in_a_mostly_white_room.jpeg?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='Image_of_a_satellite_in_a_mostly_white_room' src='/internal_resources/2698/Image_of_a_satellite_in_a_mostly_white_room.jpeg' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nThe SWOT satellite sits in a clean room at a Thales Alenia Space facility near Cannes, France, with one of its two solar arrays deployed during testing in January 2022. Credit: CNES/Thales Alenia Space\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The calibration-validation data on rivers and lakes from SWOT looked good. &ldquo;We were expecting to be able to measure rivers wider than 100 meters, but there are cases where we can see things as narrow as 50 meters, and sometimes as narrow as 20 meters,&rdquo; said Pavelsky.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>By Sea</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>SWOT sea level measurements were also promising when compared with ocean sampling data. &ldquo;My fear before launch was that we were going to get a lot of surprises in the data because SWOT is unlike anything that we&rsquo;ve done before,&rdquo; said Chen. But that hasn&rsquo;t been the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers used two approaches to measure sea levels: airborne- and ship-deployed sensors. Using an airplane-mounted lidar instrument, the team collected sea level information in a manner similar to how SWOT takes measurements. This provided the most direct comparison between data from the field and the satellite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team also collected temperature and salinity data that can reveal ocean features &ndash; like internal waves and currents &ndash; that drive sea level changes. They deployed temperature and salinity sensors on 11 moorings roughly 200 miles (300 kilometers) off California&rsquo;s central coast. And they used 11 autonomous underwater robots &ndash; some of which were also collecting data for a separate NASA project called the <a href=\"https://espo.nasa.gov/s-mode/content/S-MODE\">Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These efforts are key because as analysis methods improve and researchers find new questions to answer using SWOT data, the measurements will help to gauge their accuracy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our benchmark data,&rdquo; said Pavelsky. &ldquo;It will be important for years to come.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>More About the SWOT Mission</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>SWOT was jointly developed by NASA and CNES, with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and the UK Space Agency. JPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, leads the U.S. component of the project. For the flight system payload, NASA provided the KaRIn instrument, a GPS science receiver, a laser retroreflector, a two-beam microwave radiometer, and NASA instrument operations. CNES provided the Doppler Orbitography and Radioposition Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) system, the dual frequency Poseidon altimeter (developed by Thales Alenia Space), the KaRIn radio-frequency subsystem (together with Thales Alenia Space and with support from the UK Space Agency), the satellite platform, and ground operations. CSA provided the KaRIn high-power transmitter assembly. NASA provided the launch vehicle and the agency&rsquo;s Launch Services Program, based at Kennedy Space Center, managed the associated launch services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about SWOT, visit:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/\"><b>https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>News Media Contacts</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Jane J.

Set to launch in early 2024, NISAR &ndash; short for NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar &ndash; is being jointly developed by NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation, or ISRO, to track movements of Earth&rsquo;s land and ice surfaces in extremely fine detail. As NISAR monitors nearly every part of our planet at least once every 12 days, the satellite will also help scientists understand, among other observables, the dynamics of forests, wetlands, and agricultural lands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the size of an SUV and partially wrapped in gold-colored thermal blanketing, the satellite&rsquo;s cylindrical radar instrument payload contains two radar systems. The S-band radar is particularly useful for monitoring crop structure and the roughness of land and ice surfaces, while the L-band instrument can penetrate denser forest canopies to study the woody trunks of trees, among other observables. The wavelengths of the S-band and L-band signals are about 4 inches (10 centimeters) and 10 inches (25 centimeters), respectively, and both sensors can see through clouds and collect data day and night.</p>\r\n\r\n<section class='newsletter_cta_module' style='background-color: #F2F6FF'>\n<div class='newsletter_cta_inner_wrapper'>\n<div class='module_title'>\nGet NASA's Climate Change News\n</div>\n<div class='email_field_container'>\n<form action='/newsletter_signup/' class='body_form'>\n<input class='email_field' name='newsletter_subscribe_email' placeholder='enter email address' type='email'>\n<button class='email_submit' onMouseOut='this.style.color='#396AA2'' onMouseOver='this.style.color='#48A1C0'' style='color: #396AA2'>\n<svg height=\"100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 26 20\" width=\"100%\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"m60.5879081 230.937543c.0854372-.049231.1936357-.033361.2609299.038219l8.1980135 8.67638c.0573979.060243.0725721.148018.038925.22316-.0329873.075791-.1088582.124698-.1929759.124698h-23.4714813c-.1398664 0-.2774236-.039191-.4199289-.121459-.0577278-.032713-.096323-.091013-.1035802-.156115s.0171534-.129556.0659747-.174253l9.163223-8.345364c.0672942-.061539.1679056-.072227.2477349-.027854l2.4130239 1.353538c.3239356.180731.7362774.179112 1.0582338-.006801zm9.098032-5.453759c.0654834-.037926.1449758-.039575.2101334-.001319.0645061.037595.1039265.107181.1039265.183032v11.396496c0 .087064-.0521261.164564-.1319443.196553-.0244341.009234-.0504971.014181-.0762344.014181-.0573388 0-.1120712-.023415-.1521431-.067277l-6.7568492-7.373077c-.0420266-.0465-.0615739-.110809-.0534292-.173799.009122-.063319.0465877-.119383.1006685-.151043zm-25.5752757-.001316c.0693403-.036687.1551402-.037331.2230798-.001287l7.6225345 4.000908c.0616359.032826.1036603.090432.1113648.15544.0077045.064687-.0185608.129695-.0710914.173785l-7.6207835 6.497291c-.0420244.036044-.0970064.055031-.1519884.055031-.0308179 0-.0612857-.005792-.0900024-.0177-.0812472-.032504-.1337778-.106523-.1337778-.187945v-10.497876c0-.073054.0420244-.140959.1106644-.177647zm25.0262707-5.482468c.4761039 0 .8630649.382512.8630649.852398v1.534382c0 .101048-.0864416.152071-.1701818.208431-.0692208.046689-.2535844.148069-.3231429.18642l-12.3732987 7.189022c-.0334285.019676-.0715844.029347-.1094026.029347-.0371428 0-.0742857-.008671-.1073766-.02768l-12.7589091-7.197692c-.0709091-.036684-.1576883-.127393-.1576883-.20643v-1.715467c0-.470219.386961-.852731.8630649-.852731z\" fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" transform=\"translate(-44 -220)\"/></svg>\n</button>\n</form>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\r\n\r\n<p>The payload took a roundabout journey to get to this point. The S-band radar was built at the Space Applications Centre in Ahmedabad in western India, then flown in March 2021 to NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, where engineers had been developing NISAR&rsquo;s L-band radar. At JPL, the two systems were fixed to the payload&rsquo;s barrel-like frame before being flown to the U R Rao Satellite Centre (URSC) in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru in March 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, engineers and technicians at URSC, collaborating with teams from JPL, were busy developing the spacecraft&rsquo;s main body, or bus, which is covered in blue blanketing that protects it during assembly and testing prior to launch. The bus, which includes components and systems developed by both ISRO and JPL, will provide power, navigation, pointing control, and communications for the mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module right' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='/internal_resources/2694/Crane_lifting_NISAR_instrument_payload.jpeg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBOXlNQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--545cb7de721cee5d1eb6c899364fcc228ecd3489/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/Crane_lifting_NISAR_instrument_payload.jpeg?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='Crane_lifting_NISAR_instrument_payload' src='/internal_resources/2694/Crane_lifting_NISAR_instrument_payload.jpeg' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nA crane is used to align NISAR&rsquo;s radar instrument payload, seen partially wrapped in gold-colored thermal blanketing, with the satellite&rsquo;s spacecraft bus, which is inside blue blanketing, in an ISRO clean room in Bengaluru, India, in June.

Still to be attached: the satellite&rsquo;s solar panels, as well as the drum-shaped, wire-mesh reflector that will unfold from the end of a 30-foot (9-meter) boom. At nearly 40 feet (12 meters) in diameter, the reflector will be largest radar antenna of its kind ever launched into space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NISAR satellite is currently undergoing performance testing, to be followed by several rounds of environmental testing to ensure it can withstand the rigors of launch and meet all of its operational requirements once in orbit. Then it will be transported about 220 miles (350 kilometers) eastward to Satish Dhawan Space Centre, where it will be inserted into its launch fairing, mounted atop ISRO&rsquo;s Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark II rocket, and sent into low Earth orbit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>More About the Mission</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>NISAR is an equal collaboration between NASA and ISRO and marks the first time the two agencies have cooperated on hardware development for an Earth-observing mission. JPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, leads the U.S. component of the project and is providing the mission&rsquo;s L-band SAR. NASA is also providing the radar reflector antenna, the deployable boom, a high-rate communication subsystem for science data, GPS receivers, a solid-state recorder, and payload data subsystem. URSC, which is leading the ISRO component of the mission, is providing the spacecraft bus, the S-band SAR electronics, the launch vehicle, and associated launch services and satellite mission operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about NISAR, visit:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/\"><b>https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>News Media Contacts</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew Wang / Jane J.

The website is still in beta testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Teamwork enabled the success of this project, which included contributions from just about every NASA center and six partners across the government,\" said Laura Rogers, a NASA scientist and strategic lead of the center. &ldquo;We brought together very different perspectives &mdash; blending things like the view from space with the view from behind the wheel of a tractor &mdash; to make complex data and concepts more accessible through visuals and sound. The center is a powerful combination of space, science, Earth, and art.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There is a bit of beauty and mystery which draws you into the center and leads you to start asking questions,&rdquo; said Daniel Goods, who leads <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/thestudio\">The Studio at JPL</a>, one of the designers of the center. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re in the mindset for learning.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Seeing Earth as NASA Sees It</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As visitors enter the exhibit, they will be greeted by chirping birds and other natural sounds. Once inside, they will find a 22-foot LED hyperwall framed by two circular 4K screens. The hyperwall show tells the story of our planet through videos and visualizations on subjects like air pollution, agriculture, and hurricanes. It also includes dashboards with real-time data and imagery of our planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data visualizations reflect how the study of Earth system science works, combining scientific models, satellite observations, and ground measurements from teams across the agency and across the government, said Helen-Nicole Kostis, a <a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">data visualization</a> developer at NASA&rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and key member of the Earth Information Center team. &ldquo;The visualizations feature the latest data available, updated as often as six minutes, with the goal of making scientific data accessible to people,&rdquo; Kostis said. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Earth Information Center also includes a chandelier-like sculpture that depicts real-time satellite data transfers between space and ground receivers. Different patterns and speeds represent the amount of data being transferred and how quickly it reaches its destination.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visitors can also track NASA&rsquo;s Earth science missions in real time by using the exhibit&rsquo;s touchscreen kiosk, which allows visitors to interact with a 3D globe and zoom in to areas of interest. They can view satellite imagery of recent natural events while also monitoring Earth&rsquo;s vital signs such as carbon dioxide concentrations, ozone holes, and sea level.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/52991307296_b2805ee93f_o.jpg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<img alt='Senior federal officials watch “Space for Earth,” the immersive audio-visual installation in NASA’s Earth Information Center' src='https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/52991307296_b2805ee93f_o.jpg?itok=7atZa0X8' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson; Michael Morgan, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Environmental Observation and Prediction at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); Marlen Eve, Deputy Administrator for the Agricultural Research Service at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); and Eric Hooks, Deputy Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) watch &ldquo;Space for Earth,&rdquo; the data-driven, audio-visual installation in NASA&rsquo;s Earth Information Center.

This past winter&rsquo;s bonanza of atmospheric rivers alleviated some of the water deficit that the state incurred during periods of drought over the last 10 years, which included the three driest years on record in California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think of the state&rsquo;s Central Valley region (outlined in yellow, above) as a giant swimming pool: GRACE-FO measurements include all the water contained in the lakes, rivers, soil, snowpack, and underground aquifers within that region. Between October 2022 and March 2023, storms provided enough water to raise the amount of water within the &ldquo;swimming pool&rdquo; by about 20 inches (about 500 millimeters). That&rsquo;s about twice as much as the average winter water gain since satellite-based water storage measurements began in 2002 with the first <a href=\"https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/\">GRACE</a> mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure class='embedded_video video_player_container column-width'>\n<div class='video_wrapper'>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NunPg4Lc85A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\nThis animation shows changes in the total amount of water within the California region outlined in yellow &ndash; including the Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Tulare river basins &ndash; from 2002 to 2023.

The GRACE-FO team will continue to track how California&rsquo;s water storage evolves through the summer after the snowpack melts and water levels in the state&rsquo;s lakes, rivers, and reservoirs start to recede during drier weather.</p>\r\n\r\n<section class='newsletter_cta_module' style='background-color: #F2F6FF'>\n<div class='newsletter_cta_inner_wrapper'>\n<div class='module_title'>\nGet NASA's Climate Change News\n</div>\n<div class='email_field_container'>\n<form action='/newsletter_signup/' class='body_form'>\n<input class='email_field' name='newsletter_subscribe_email' placeholder='enter email address' type='email'>\n<button class='email_submit' onMouseOut='this.style.color='#396AA2'' onMouseOver='this.style.color='#48A1C0'' style='color: #396AA2'>\n<svg height=\"100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 26 20\" width=\"100%\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"m60.5879081 230.937543c.0854372-.049231.1936357-.033361.2609299.038219l8.1980135 8.67638c.0573979.060243.0725721.148018.038925.22316-.0329873.075791-.1088582.124698-.1929759.124698h-23.4714813c-.1398664 0-.2774236-.039191-.4199289-.121459-.0577278-.032713-.096323-.091013-.1035802-.156115s.0171534-.129556.0659747-.174253l9.163223-8.345364c.0672942-.061539.1679056-.072227.2477349-.027854l2.4130239 1.353538c.3239356.180731.7362774.179112 1.0582338-.006801zm9.098032-5.453759c.0654834-.037926.1449758-.039575.2101334-.001319.0645061.037595.1039265.107181.1039265.183032v11.396496c0 .087064-.0521261.164564-.1319443.196553-.0244341.009234-.0504971.014181-.0762344.014181-.0573388 0-.1120712-.023415-.1521431-.067277l-6.7568492-7.373077c-.0420266-.0465-.0615739-.110809-.0534292-.173799.009122-.063319.0465877-.119383.1006685-.151043zm-25.5752757-.001316c.0693403-.036687.1551402-.037331.2230798-.001287l7.6225345 4.000908c.0616359.032826.1036603.090432.1113648.15544.0077045.064687-.0185608.129695-.0710914.173785l-7.6207835 6.497291c-.0420244.036044-.0970064.055031-.1519884.055031-.0308179 0-.0612857-.005792-.0900024-.0177-.0812472-.032504-.1337778-.106523-.1337778-.187945v-10.497876c0-.073054.0420244-.140959.1106644-.177647zm25.0262707-5.482468c.4761039 0 .8630649.382512.8630649.852398v1.534382c0 .101048-.0864416.152071-.1701818.208431-.0692208.046689-.2535844.148069-.3231429.18642l-12.3732987 7.189022c-.0334285.019676-.0715844.029347-.1094026.029347-.0371428 0-.0742857-.008671-.1073766-.02768l-12.7589091-7.197692c-.0709091-.036684-.1576883-.127393-.1576883-.20643v-1.715467c0-.470219.386961-.852731.8630649-.852731z\" fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" transform=\"translate(-44 -220)\"/></svg>\n</button>\n</form>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\r\n\r\n<p>The observations were made possible through the unique sensing approach taken by both GRACE missions. As water moves around &ndash; in the form of ocean currents, falling rain, shifting groundwater, ice, and so on &ndash; it alters the planet&rsquo;s mass near the surface, which changes Earth&rsquo;s gravitational pull ever so slightly. GRACE-FO measures these subtle changes, enabling researchers to estimate changes in the total volume of water in an area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like its predecessor, the GRACE-FO mission consists of two identical satellites that fly one behind the other. As the lead satellite flies over an area with greater mass &ndash; such as an area with more water than another region &ndash; the slight change in gravity tugs it forward, increasing the distance between the two satellites. Microwave and laser instruments aboard the spacecraft precisely measure the minute distance changes between the two, revealing details about the overall mass of water that caused those changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='/internal_resources/2683/Terrestrial_water_storage_changes_in_California.jpeg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBNm1JQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f17082711bbd23b1c83cd9386c6733d025b9503d/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/Terrestrial_water_storage_changes_in_California.jpeg?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='Terrestrial_water_storage_changes_in_California' src='/internal_resources/2683/Terrestrial_water_storage_changes_in_California.jpeg' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nThe line graph shows seasonal changes in the total amount of water contained in California&rsquo;s lakes, rivers, reservoirs, snowpack, and groundwater from 2002 to 2023.

But human actions are affecting the natural balance of life on Earth. This includes habitat loss from <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145988/tracking-amazon-deforestation-from-above\">deforestation</a>, land use changes, and climate change. Rising global temperatures, a more <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/acidification.html\">acidic</a> ocean, and extreme weather events &mdash; from heat waves and droughts to floods and wildfires &mdash; are rapidly changing global ecosystems. Larger organisms often take thousands to millions of years to evolve and adapt to new climates. Earth&rsquo;s climate is now changing faster than many species can handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NASA is working with partners worldwide to monitor biodiversity changes in near real-time, linking satellite data to on-the-ground measurements. Through these measurements, scientists are working swiftly to learn what is happening and its impact on the planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Satellites Have Tracked Changes to Life on Earth for Decades</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<figure class='embedded_video video_player_container column-width'>\n<div class='video_wrapper'>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_iql4jByQM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\nLandsat and other satellites provide snapshots of life on Earth over time.

NASA satellites play a vital role in gathering biodiversity data from a distance, often from orbit; this is what we call <a href=\"https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/backgrounders/remote-sensing\">remote sensing</a>. According to Turner, when satellite imagery is combined with airborne and <a class=\"glossary_link\" href=\"/resources/glossary/?alpha=A-Z:title&ss_id=70\" title=\"Measurements that are collected at a known location, usually in the field. Examples include motion-activated cameras, sound recorders, and citizen science networks.\">in-situ</a> or field data, it helps to show where plants and animals are living and thriving at a given time, allowing for long-term tracking of changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Laura Lorenzoni, program manager for <a href=\"https://cce.nasa.gov/ocean_biology_biogeochemistry/index.html\">NASA&rsquo;s Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry Program</a>, echoed the importance of sustained and detailed satellite measurements for predicting future changes. Lorenzoni and her colleagues are using remote-sensing and field data, together with models, to answer questions about how climate change is altering marine ecosystems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NASA has also made a priority of researching impacts to biodiversity on land. For decades, scientists funded by <a href=\"https://cce.nasa.gov/biodiversity/index.html\">NASA&rsquo;s Biological Diversity Research Program and Ecological Forecasting Applications Program</a> have been using satellites to track biodiversity and ecosystem changes and to help develop tools to aid in conservation. For instance, NASA-funded researchers are developing forecasting tools for <a href=\"https://cce.nasa.gov/biodiversity/_biomap/projmap.html?projType=project&projID=4444&progID=10\">managing wildlife migrations</a> along the Yukon-to-Yellowstone corridor, and others are <a href=\"https://cce.nasa.gov/biodiversity/_biomap/projmap.html?projType=project&projID=4277&progID=10\">mapping changes</a> in North American temperate forests due to disease and climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Better Data for Hard-to-Reach Places</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBem1DQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8bf5c94264798bf79e72886235de82d5478aa469/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/Example_of_Hyperspectral_Data_Cube.png?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='A cube that has a picture of green and brown land on top.

Each layer shows data from a different wavelength of light measured by a satellite. Different types of vegetation will generate a unique pattern of light that reflects back to the instrument, even though our eyes see it all as green. This helps scientists identify not just that there is green vegetation in a location, but that it&rsquo;s a forest of oak trees, for example. Credit: <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/hsi-hdf5-r\">NASA/NSF NEON</a>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>New remote-sensing technologies can help expand our view of the environment and how it&rsquo;s changing. This includes the advancement of satellites to collect <a href=\"https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/pathfinders/biodiversity/biodiversity-spectroscopy\">hyperspectral data</a>, which identify an object&rsquo;s or organism&rsquo;s composition based on how it interacts with light. This means an oak tree leaf will look different from a pine tree leaf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hyperspectral data will move us leaps and bounds in our understanding of biodiversity. It lets you see not just where vegetation is, but what it is, too,&rdquo; said Dr. Allison Leidner, a conservation biologist and program scientist in NASA&rsquo;s Earth Science Directorate. For example, instead of seeing just a green forest, scientists can identify that it is a forest of oak trees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the data, scientists can help identify how environmental changes impact different types of plants within ecosystems. This new insight can fill in missing information about how ecosystems are changing due to human actions &mdash; particularly in remote, hard-to-reach places &mdash; providing a more complete global picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NASA&rsquo;s upcoming <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-system-observatory\">Earth System Observatory</a> program will provide high-resolution open data to scientists for developing solutions that address both climate change and biodiversity losses. For example, the <a href=\"https://pace.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE)</a> mission aims to uncover how climate change is impacting <a class=\"glossary_link\" href=\"/resources/glossary/?alpha=A-Z:title&ss_id=71\" title=\"Microscopic marine plants that drift along water currents.\">phytoplankton</a>, the organisms at the center of the marine food web. With its Ocean Color Instrument, the PACE satellite will provide new high-resolution views of this microscopic ocean life. With these data, scientists will be able to track the changing state of phytoplankton in different ocean basins and regions, which is important to understanding ocean biodiversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although scientists do not have all the solutions yet, NASA&rsquo;s current and upcoming missions provide or will provide critical insights into the effort to slow biodiversity loss. Through continued research and new technology, scientists worldwide are working to find solutions so we can enjoy birdsongs for generations to come.</p>\r\n",

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Methane has a much shorter atmospheric lifespan than carbon dioxide &ndash; around 12 years, compared to centuries for carbon dioxide &ndash; but it absorbs much more energy while it exists in the atmosphere. Therefore, reducing human-caused emissions of the gas is a particularly effective way to make significant, short-term impacts on global climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;These papers demonstrate that methane reductions are not only possible, they&rsquo;re measurable through persistent monitoring,&rdquo; said Andrew Thorpe, lead author of the COVID-period study and a JPL research technologist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That two studies could use different techniques to identify and quantify emissions trends is crucial for generating confidence in the conclusions drawn from methane observations, added Vineet Yadav, a JPL data scientist and lead author of the first paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The important thing is to determine whether emissions are increasing or declining, and for that it&rsquo;s helpful to have more than one approach,&rdquo; said Yadav, whose study employs two techniques. &ldquo;If you are turning the information over to decision-makers, you have to be sure.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Focusing on the Region</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Yadav&rsquo;s paper is based on measurements from eight spectroscopic sensors that were installed as part of the Megacities Carbon Project, a multiagency collaboration currently monitoring greenhouse gases in the Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and Washington areas. The sensors have been gathering data across a large swath of Southern California since 2015 and enabled researchers to study an area that stretches from the beaches of Malibu in the west to the mountains and deserts of San Bernardino and Riverside counties in the east. It also extends south through all of Orange County.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers found that month-to-month fluctuations in methane concentrations measured at each sensor tower gradually fell from 2015 to 2020 and well into 2022 &ndash; a strong indication that local emissions of the gas were also decreasing. Then, using a mathematical model to estimate the emissions decrease, Yadav and colleagues found the areas covered by the Granada Hills and Ontario sensors accounted for much of the drop in annual emissions from 2015 to 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the paper doesn&rsquo;t cite causes of the emission reductions in those two locales, Yadav suspects they resulted from better management of natural gas pipelines and equipment, which in turn led to lower fugitive &ndash; or accidental &ndash; methane releases. <a href=\"https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/articles/mapping-methane-in-california\">Improved infrastructure</a> at a massive waste site near Granada Hills likely also played a role.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='/internal_resources/2674/Three_bar_graphs_showing_methane_emission_rates_by_industry__by_sector__and_total.jpeg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBNENGQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--15e1499253c486fe653afa95847c2788ec7d406b/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/Three_bar_graphs_showing_methane_emission_rates_by_industry__by_sector__and_total.jpeg?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='Three_bar_graphs_showing_methane_emission_rates_by_industry__by_sector__and_total' src='/internal_resources/2674/Three_bar_graphs_showing_methane_emission_rates_by_industry__by_sector__and_total.jpeg' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nA March 2023 study by JPL researchers compared methane emissions in 2020, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, from both oil fields in the San Joaquin Valley and refineries and power plants in Los Angeles County to emissions measured in 2016-17. It found large reductions in overall emission rates. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Focusing on Refineries</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than analyzing data from ground sensors, the study focusing on oil refineries uses measurements made by an imaging spectrometer called AVIRIS-NG (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation). Attached to the bottom of an aircraft, the instrument can detect greenhouse gas emissions from individual facilities or even pieces of equipment by looking at how the gases absorb sunlight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016 and 2017, AVIRIS-NG was flown over 22,000 square miles (57,000 square kilometers) of the state as part of the <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/a-third-of-california-methane-traced-to-a-few-super-emitters\">California Methane Survey</a>. From July to September 2020, researchers retraced some of those flight paths over refineries and power plants in Los Angeles County and over oilfields in central California&rsquo;s San Joaquin Valley. The flights were funded by NASA&rsquo;s Earth Science Division, the California Air Resources Board, and the California Energy Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2020 surveys over Los Angeles identified only 11 plumes from five refinery sources, with a total emissions rate of about 712 pounds (323 kilograms) of methane per hour. The 2016 and &rsquo;17 flights had found 48 plumes from 33 sources, with a total emissions rate of roughly 2,639 pounds (1,197 kilograms methane) per hour. The drop correlates with an 18% decrease in monthly production in Southern California refineries between the two flight campaigns, the scientists noted, citing data from the California Energy Commission. The study also found that emissions from oilfields in and around the city of Bakersfield in central California fell 34.2%, correlating with a 24.2% drop in oil production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thorpe said that reduced production during the pandemic due to lower demand for fuel and depressed oil prices could have led to the drop in methane emissions, as oilfields and refineries emitted less methane during operations. However, he added, improved equipment maintenance and mitigation efforts at those facilities between 2016 and 2020 can&rsquo;t be ruled out as a factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&rsquo;s estimate of global atmospheric methane concentration accelerated after 2020, &ldquo;underscoring the critical need to reduce emissions,&rdquo; Thorpe writes in the paper. Being able to accurately detect and measure emissions is a key step, both he and Yadav said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For decades, NASA has been developing and using innovative tools to observe changes in greenhouse gas concentrations driven by both human activity and natural variations. For instance, in 2022 the agency launched the <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/methane-super-emitters-mapped-by-nasas-new-earth-space-mission\">EMIT</a> mission (short for the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation), which can identify methane point-source emissions. Additionally, JPL is <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-built-instrument-will-help-to-spot-greenhouse-gas-super-emitters\">partnering</a> with Carbon Mapper and Planet Labs PBC to launch satellites with greenhouse-gas monitoring capabilities. The agency is also working to make data more accessible and combining it with other sources to make user experiences easier and more efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>News Media Contacts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew Wang / Jane J.

Each year, weeds, grasses, and trees release massive amounts of tiny pollen spores into the air to allow the plants to reproduce. That pollen gets into our eyes, ears, noses, and throats, which makes lots of us sneeze and itch, and can make breathing especially difficult for asthma sufferers.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBN21FQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4f83a3e7815043d6ba69448c92fbccc62a217336/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/Person_Sneezing_From_Allergies.jpeg?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='A woman in a red blouse covering their nose and mouth with a white tissue in their hand.

This is leading to more pollen in the air and a longer allergy season. A 2012 <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23065327/\">study</a> found longer growing seasons may cause U.S. pollen levels to more than double by 2040.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A University of Maryland-led team <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.7551\">investigated</a> how changes in the timing of spring's arrival affected asthma hospitalizations. They used the <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php\">Normalized Difference Vegetation Index</a>, derived from NASA satellite observations, to determine the arrival of spring by showing the relative &ldquo;greenness&rdquo; of vegetation.

A single gram of permafrost soil can contain thousands of microbial species. Some of these viruses, microbes, and bacteria could be resistant to antibiotics. Scientists worry antibiotic-resistant permafrost organisms could exchange genetic material with modern bacteria, creating superbugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent NASA-led research has cataloged these potential hazards. A study led by Kimberley Miner of NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory examined the biological, chemical, and radioactive materials stored in ice, snow, and permafrost. The researchers noted that re-introducing ancient microorganisms back into the Arctic environment could disrupt ecosystems, kill wildlife, and put human health at risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies show about two-thirds of permafrost near the Arctic land surface may thaw by 2100. More than three million people live on permafrost in Earth&rsquo;s high northern latitudes, and Arctic commerce, resource extraction, tourism, and populations are rising. This increases the risk humans may be exposed to emerging hazards and then transport them globally.</p>\r\n",

The data shows Kelvin waves &ndash; which are roughly 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) high at the ocean surface and hundreds of miles wide &ndash; moving from west to east along the equator toward the west coast of South America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When they form at the equator, Kelvin waves bring warm water, which is associated with higher sea levels, from the western Pacific to the eastern Pacific. A series of Kelvin waves starting in spring is a well-known precursor to an El Ni&ntilde;o, a periodic climate phenomenon that can affect weather patterns around the world. It is characterized by higher sea levels and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures along the western coasts of the Americas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://sealevel.nasa.gov/understanding-sea-level/global-sea-level/thermal-expansion\">Water expands as it warms</a>, so sea levels tend to be higher in places with warmer water. El Ni&ntilde;o is also associated with a weakening of the trade winds. The condition can bring cooler, wetter conditions to the U.S. Southwest and drought to countries in the western Pacific, such as Indonesia and Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='/internal_resources/2672/Sea_level_satellite_data_graphic.jpeg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBenlGQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--924de0d1ec93022ceebbe9c9744d3e81bda598cd/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/Sea_level_satellite_data_graphic.jpeg?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='Sea_level_satellite_data_graphic' src='/internal_resources/2672/Sea_level_satellite_data_graphic.jpeg' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nSea level data from the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite on April 24 shows relatively higher (shown in red and white) and warmer ocean water at the equator and the west coast of South America.

By April 24, Kelvin waves had piled up warmer water and higher sea levels (shown in red and white) off the coasts of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. Satellites like Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich can detect Kelvin waves with a radar altimeter, which uses microwave signals to measure the height of the ocean&rsquo;s surface. When an altimeter passes over areas that are warmer than others, the data will show higher sea levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be watching this El Ni&ntilde;o like a hawk,&rdquo; said Josh Willis, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich project scientist at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a big one, the globe will see record warming, but here in the Southwest U.S. we could be looking at another wet winter, right on the heels of the soaking we got last winter.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the World Meteorological Organization have recently reported increased chances that El Ni&ntilde;o will develop by the end of the summer. Continued monitoring of ocean conditions in the Pacific by instruments and satellites such as Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich should help to clarify in the coming months how strong it could become.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When we measure sea level from space using satellite altimeters, we know not only the shape and height of water, but also its movement, like Kelvin and other waves,&rdquo; said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, NASA program scientist and manager for Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich in Washington. &ldquo;Ocean waves slosh heat around the planet, bringing heat and moisture to our coasts and changing our weather.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>More About the Mission</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, named after former NASA Earth Science Division Director Michael Freilich, is one of two satellites that compose the Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS (Continuity of Service) mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sentinel-6/Jason-CS was jointly developed by ESA (European Space Agency), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), NASA, and NOAA, with funding support from the European Commission and technical support on performance from the French space agency CNES (Centre National d&rsquo;&Eacute;tudes Spatiales).

NASA also contributed launch services, ground systems supporting operation of the NASA science instruments, the science data processors for two of these instruments, and support for the U.S. members of the international Ocean Surface Topography Science Team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, visit:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sentinel-6\"><b>https://www.nasa.gov/sentinel-6</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>News Media Contacts</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Jane J.

The study also outlined how researchers at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and counterparts in Belize used free, cloud-based data on Google Earth Engine in their analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We depend on the reef for so many things, so conserving these resources is important,&rdquo; said Emil Cherrington, a native Belizean and co-author of the paper. He is a research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and a co-investigator on the Belize Sustainable Development Goal project, a NASA effort to use Earth observation data to protect the country&rsquo;s marine ecosystems. &ldquo;Studies like this are giving the government of Belize more tools for conserving the resources that the country has.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/e1-pia25861-belize-1041.jpg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<img alt=' Belize’s coral reefs' src='https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/e1-pia25861-belize-1041.jpg?itok=FtZwJxn6' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nResearchers at JPL, alongside colleagues in Belize, used 20 years of data from MODIS, an instrument on NASA&rsquo;s Aqua satellite, to assess risk to Belize&rsquo;s coral reefs due to human activity and climate change.

Coral needs clear water and consistent temperatures to grow. Changes in both factors can affect the survival of the symbiotic algae that live in the coral and provide food. When the algae leave or die, the coral lose their color, a phenomenon called bleaching. Coral can survive under these conditions, but the changes can put it at greater risk of mortality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To gather data on water clarity and surface temperature over large areas, researchers turned to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (<a href=\"https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">MODIS</a>), which was developed at NASA&rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and launched in 2002 as one of several instruments aboard the agency&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://aqua.nasa.gov/\">Aqua</a> satellite. In addition to being available from NASA, MODIS images and data sets are accessible on Google Earth Engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analyzing MODIS imagery collected from 2002 to 2022, the researchers developed a vulnerability index that characterizes the risk to coral in the marine environments that Belize is managing in order to protect biodiversity. The team examined sea surface temperatures in each protected area and assigned a number from 1 to 6 based on how low or high the averages were relative to the norms. They did the same for water clarity. The 1 to 6 ratings were then combined to get the coral index, from 2 to 12. Higher numbers signify greater risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module right' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/e2-pia25862-belize-mpa-1041.jpg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<img alt='Map of Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System' src='https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/side_image/public/thumbnails/image/e2-pia25862-belize-mpa-1041.jpg?itok=Nc8tCcCY' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nOf the 24 marine protected areas ranked in the study of the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System and mapped here, Port Honduras Marine Reserve off southern Belize had the highest coral vulnerability score: 10 out of 12.

Based on the index, the study also flagged Swallow Caye Wildlife Sanctuary, Sapodilla Cayes Marine Reserve, and Corozal Bay Wildlife Sanctuary as areas for concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the protected areas in the study are included in the Belize Coastal Zone Management Plan, a framework to guide Belize&rsquo;s government on how to support the sustainable use of the country&rsquo;s coastal areas. The country&rsquo;s Coastal Zone Management Authority & Institute, which is tasked with implementing and monitoring policies that govern Belize&rsquo;s coastal waters, created the last plan in 2016. The new paper, along with other Belize-focused research sponsored through NASA&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/\">Earth Applied Sciences</a> program, will inform the next plan, which is currently being revised, said Samir Rosado, a co-author of the study and a coastal planner at the management authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of our cultural identity arises from the marine areas,&rdquo; Rosado said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a measure of pride &ndash; wherever Belizeans go, people know the coral reefs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>What&rsquo;s Next</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The vulnerability index could be used for other reef systems around the world, and it could be modified to incorporate additional water variables such as acidity, said Ileana Callejas, the paper&rsquo;s lead author and a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. Rising ocean acidity &ndash; a consequence of climate change resulting from greater concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide in the water &ndash; threatens coral health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We were trying to make the data and our approach as accessible as possible,&rdquo; said Callejas, who started the research during an internship at JPL. &ldquo;Our main purpose was to make a toolkit that would be easy to use, that would produce an index that was easy to understand, and that could be used to see which marine protected areas may need closer attention.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the historical record and traditional field testing by boat have given coastal management authorities a sense of the most vulnerable areas, satellites can shine light on other spots that may be less accessible or more costly to reach, said Nicole Auil Gomez, a paper co-author and director of the Wildlife Conservation Society&rsquo;s Belize Country Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It's going to become more useful in the future in terms of telling us more about areas we already monitor,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And for areas we don&rsquo;t monitor, we have some tools now to be able to learn more.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>News Media Contacts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew Wang / Jane J.

This phenomenon is known as &ldquo;clear-air turbulence.&rdquo; British atmospheric scientist Paul Williams of the University of Reading studies clear-air turbulence. Among his findings:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>By 2050, the frequency of reported clear-air turbulence is expected to double, and the average strength of turbulence is expected to increase by 10 to 40%.</li>\r\n\t<li>Severe turbulence at typical airplane cruising altitudes could become two to three times more common. This will impact airspace over large regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='/internal_resources/2654/special_infrasound_microphone.jpeg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMkYvQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6047edbfbda98abf6e3dc52ca83bd412859706a2/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/special_infrasound_microphone.jpeg?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='special_infrasound_microphone' src='/internal_resources/2654/special_infrasound_microphone.jpeg' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nResearchers at NASA&rsquo;s Langley Research Center designed a special infrasound microphone that could pick up the ultralow frequencies generated by turbulence in the skies.

Researchers at NASA&rsquo;s Langley Research Center recently designed a <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/spinoff/NASA_Microphone_Detects_Turbulence_Hundreds_of_Miles_Away\">special infrasound microphone</a> that can \"hear\" ultralow frequencies generated by turbulence. This technology was tested on an uncrewed stratospheric glider called HiDRON.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Climate change can also make it harder for aircraft to take off. As temperatures rise, air becomes less dense, so planes have a harder time generating the lift they need to become airborne. Because of this, some aircraft runways may not be long enough for certain planes to take off. It also might force aircraft operators to reduce the takeoff weight of planes and helicopters.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='/internal_resources/2657/Arctic_sea_ice_extent_on_March_6__2023.jpeg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMlIvQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5b865fdf345a135bfcd5172dc606fb13b00e2491/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/Arctic_sea_ice_extent_on_March_6__2023.jpeg?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='Arctic_sea_ice_extent_on_March_6__2023' src='/internal_resources/2657/Arctic_sea_ice_extent_on_March_6__2023.jpeg' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nMap showing the extent of Arctic sea ice on March 6, 2023, the day of its annual maximum.

Over the past 40 years, the amount of ice cover at both the annual maximum and minimum has shrunk, and the percentage of thick ice that survives from year to year has also dropped. As <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/91981/shipping-responds-to-arctic-ice-decline\">reported</a> in 2018, this has opened the Arctic to new commerce opportunities, but also to serious environmental concerns. At the center of both lies the shipping industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module right' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='/internal_resources/2659/Arctic_indigenous_peoples_on_sea_ice.jpeg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMmQvQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ff2391344d79623b5deec5fe1ed49498dc315071/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/Arctic_indigenous_peoples_on_sea_ice.jpeg?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='Arctic_indigenous_peoples_on_sea_ice' src='/internal_resources/2659/Arctic_indigenous_peoples_on_sea_ice.jpeg' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nInuit and other indigenous peoples of the Arctic travel the sea ice by snow machine and by dog team.

This can significantly shorten travel times between Asia, Europe, and North America. As a result, many nations are preparing for more Arctic shipping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also negatives. Scientists and environmentalists worry more shipping activity will increase pollution and oil spills and disturb marine life. And ships are still encountering plenty of ice as they sail closer to the North Pole and in waters that are not well charted. Increased exploration and tourism also mean search-and-rescue operations become more challenging for the U.S. and Canadian coast guards. Finally, some traditional travel routes over the sea ice (used by snowmobiles, trucks, and other vehicles) could become unsafe as the ice thins.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>(Not) Rollin&rsquo; on the River</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='/internal_resources/2660/Mississippi_River.jpeg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<source srcset='/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMjUvQWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--650b803e4c61309e64ee3ea140821ab37b738e65/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MWm05eWJXRjBPZ2wzWldKdyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--308d105b858fde2aa7c2bd953e87f719e2dd73bb/Mississippi_River.jpeg?content_type=image%2Fwebp&disposition=inline' type='image/webp'>\n<img alt='Mississippi_River' src='/internal_resources/2660/Mississippi_River.jpeg' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nLandsat 7 captured this image of the Mississippi River just south of Memphis, Tennessee, on August 8, 2012.

Water levels can drop such that rivers can become too shallow to navigate, and some ships may have to carry less cargo to safely navigate a river. In the United States, cargo transport along the Mississippi River has been impacted in recent years. For example, low water in 2012 closed an 11-mile stretch of the Mississippi River near Memphis. Such closures have a big economic impact along the river.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><i>Read part 2 of this series: <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3267/when-climate-gets-under-your-skin/\">https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3267/when-climate-gets-under-your-skin/</a>.</i></p>\r\n",

      "body": "<p>NASA has been working to better understand our home planet from the unique vantage point of space since the first TIROS satellites launched in the 1960s. Today, with more than two dozen Earth-observing satellites and instruments, it&rsquo;s clearer than ever that our planet is an interconnected system. Local events can have global impacts and global events impact local communities. Recognizing that the challenges of today and tomorrow require an agency-wide effort, NASA&rsquo;s Office of the Chief Scientist established a cross-agency working group and released &ldquo;Advancing NASA&rsquo;s Climate Strategy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The last nine years have been the hottest ever recorded. That is simply an indisputable fact, underscoring the need for bold action to protect our planet,&rdquo; said Administrator Bill Nelson. &ldquo;NASA&rsquo;s climate strategy is a declaration of our continued commitment to lead on climate &ndash; and how we intend to do so.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A PDF version of the full &ldquo;Advancing NASA&rsquo;s Climate Strategy&rdquo; document is available <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/advancing_nasas_climate_strategy_2023.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strategy assesses NASA&rsquo;s climate portfolio across the agency for the first time, extending beyond science and exploration efforts to include every mission directorate and NASA facility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The climate and Earth system are changing, and this impacts not only what science we need, but also how we think about our operations and mission safety,&rdquo; said Kate Calvin, NASA&rsquo;s chief scientist and senior climate advisor. &ldquo;This strategy will help NASA integrate our understanding of climate across the agency and in our partnerships to better serve the public.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strategy lays out four key priorities for the agency to aide with the integration of climate across NASA: innovate, inform, inspire, and partner. The first priority of innovation relies on continuing NASA&rsquo;s 60+ years of Earth science studied not only from space &ndash; but also through airborne research, direct measurements and field campaigns. With new missions coming online in 2023 to observe air pollution (<a href=\"https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/tropospheric-emissions-monitoring-pollution-evi-1\">TEMPO</a>), Earth&rsquo;s water to help improve climate models (<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/swot\">SWOT</a>), and the increasing intensity of storms (<a href=\"https://weather.ndc.nasa.gov/tropics/\">TROPICS</a>), NASA-powered observations of our planet are at the core of how we study the effects of climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NASA&rsquo;s innovation efforts also extend to aeronautics engineering, as NASA seeks to advance the development of greener aerospace technology. Such advances in science and engineering can also lay a foundation for future innovation as NASA technologies and know-how are shared with the world, including agency collaborations to develop <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-advance-3d-printing-quantum-tech-for-climate-research/\">remote sensing technology</a>, combat wildfires, and develop <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/tdm/fission-surface-power/index.html\">space power systems</a> that could advance power alternatives on Earth. Finally, we are working to ensure the sustainability of NASA centers and facilities, including reducing agency greenhouse gas emissions and increasing resiliency to climate variability and change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strategy also lays out our commitment to inform the public and decision-makers around the world. NASA is focused on improving the accessibility and usability of climate and Earth science information. From seaside towns who wish to know more about their changing coastlines, to those in wildfire-vulnerable areas, to city-dwellers looking to track smog in their neighborhoods, communities around the world can benefit from NASA&rsquo;s observations and models to help plan for the future. Providing resources that draw on NASA observations and models can help support everyone in preparing for and responding to climate change.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than just providing information, one of NASA&rsquo;s goals is always to inspire and to educate. As we make our observations about Earth accessible to the world, we are also seeking to encourage and train the next generation of climate researchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the strategy discusses the key role that partnering across agencies, institutions, and industries plays in understanding and responding to climate change. NASA will continue and enhance coordination and partnerships with other federal agencies, international entities, and state, local, and tribal governments to deliver actionable climate information to stakeholders &ndash; and ensure the broadest applicability of NASA climate information and technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;NASA&rsquo;s decades-long and vast array of Earth, atmospheric, and solar data have long been one of the foundations of how we understand climate and the Earth system,&rdquo; said Karen St. Germain, director of NASA&rsquo;s Earth Science Division. &ldquo;By studying Earth as a system &ndash; from a variety of viewpoints and through many different instruments and scientific fields &ndash; NASA&rsquo;s integrated approach is key for better understanding our home planet. And understanding it gives us the means to better protect it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A PDF version of the full &ldquo;Advancing NASA&rsquo;s Climate Strategy&rdquo; document is available <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/advancing_nasas_climate_strategy_2023.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>News Media Contacts:</h2>\r\n\r\n<div>Katherine Rohloff</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Headquarters, Washington</div>\r\n\r\n<div>katherine.a.rohloff@nasa.gov</div>\r\n",

(&ldquo;J&ouml;kull&rdquo; is Icelandic for &ldquo;glacier.&rdquo;) A 1901 geological map estimated that Okj&ouml;kull spanned about 15 square miles (38 square kilometers). In 1978, aerial photography showed the glacier had shrunk to about 1 square mile (3 square kilometers). Today, less than half a square mile (less than 1 square kilometer) remains. <a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145439/okjokull-remembered\" target=\"_blank\">Read more at NASA's Earth Observatory.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<div class='ioc_module_container column-width'>\n<div data-react-class=\"ImagesOfChange\" data-react-props=\"{\"id\":\"774\",\"site_nav\":null,\"data_url\":\"/api/v1/gallery_images\",\"default\":null,\"categories\":null,\"about\":null,\"unique_id\":\"ioc_1460\"}\" data-react-cache-id=\"ImagesOfChange-0\" id=\"ioc_1460\" class=\"ioc_module\"></div>\n<footer class='ioc_module_footer'>\n<a href='/images-of-change'>More Images of Change ›</a>\n</footer>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The southeastern coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, changes constantly under the influence of currents, tides, waves, and storms. For example, in the 1984 image, the barrier spit (the long, narrow strip at the eastern edge) known as North Beach is unbroken. The Patriot's Day storm in 2007 cut an inlet through it, and the southern part became North Beach Island. Researchers have identified a cycle that repeats roughly every 150 years, in which the barrier is breached, regenerates, stretches southward, and is breached again. The lower islands, too, reform under the ever-changing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<div class='ioc_module_container column-width'>\n<div data-react-class=\"ImagesOfChange\" data-react-props=\"{\"id\":\"749\",\"site_nav\":null,\"data_url\":\"/api/v1/gallery_images\",\"default\":null,\"categories\":null,\"about\":null,\"unique_id\":\"ioc_5465\"}\" data-react-cache-id=\"ImagesOfChange-0\" id=\"ioc_5465\" class=\"ioc_module\"></div>\n<footer class='ioc_module_footer'>\n<a href='/images-of-change'>More Images of Change ›</a>\n</footer>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Hudson Bay, which is considered a sea of the Arctic Ocean despite being surrounded by land, freezes over completely in winter and thaws in summer. These images show the decrease in ice over the course of 16 days in July 2020. During the thaw, polar bears travel over the slowly melting sea ice to hunt for ringed seals and other prey. When the ice becomes too scarce, the bears fast and wait for it to return. The area has lost about a third of the polar bear population since the 1980s, dropping the count from about 1200 to 800, apparently because declining summer sea ice has given them less opportunity to feed.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<div class='ioc_module_container column-width'>\n<div data-react-class=\"ImagesOfChange\" data-react-props=\"{\"id\":\"713\",\"site_nav\":null,\"data_url\":\"/api/v1/gallery_images\",\"default\":null,\"categories\":null,\"about\":null,\"unique_id\":\"ioc_3357\"}\" data-react-cache-id=\"ImagesOfChange-0\" id=\"ioc_3357\" class=\"ioc_module\"></div>\n<footer class='ioc_module_footer'>\n<a href='/images-of-change'>More Images of Change ›</a>\n</footer>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting in 1970, Canc&uacute;n, Mexico, transformed from an impoverished town of about 100 people into a vacation destination with a permanent population of 740,000 and 2 million visitors per year.

The two antennas of SWOT&rsquo;s Ka-band Radar Interferometer (<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/latest-international-water-satellite-packs-an-engineering-punch\">KaRIn</a>) instrument acquired data that was mapped as a pair of wide, colored strips spanning a total of 75 miles (120 kilometers) across. Red and orange areas in the images represent sea levels that are higher than the global average, while the shades of blue represent sea levels that are lower than average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For comparison, the new data is shown alongside sea surface height data taken by space-based instruments called <a href=\"https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/technology/\">altimeters</a>. The instruments &ndash; widely used to measure sea level &ndash; also bounce radar signals off of Earth&rsquo;s surface to collect their measurements. But traditional altimeters are able to look only at a narrow beam of Earth directly beneath them, unlike KaRIn&rsquo;s two wide-swath strips that observe sea level as a two-dimensional map.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spatial resolution of SWOT ocean measurements is 10 times greater than the composite of sea surface height data gathered over the same area by seven other satellites: Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, Jason-3, Sentinel-3A and 3B, Cryosat-2, Altika, and Hai Yang 2B. The composite image was created using information from the Copernicus Marine Service of ESA (European Space Agency) and shows the same day as the SWOT data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KaRIn also measured the elevation of water features on Long Island &ndash; shown as bright pink splotches nestled within the landscape. (Purple, yellow, green, and blue shades represent different land elevations.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our ability to measure freshwater resources on a global scale through satellite data is of prime importance as we seek to adjust to a changing climate,&rdquo; said CNES Chairman and CEO Philippe Baptiste. &ldquo;In this respect, the first views from SWOT give us a clearer picture than ever before. These data will prove highly valuable for the international scientific community in the fields of hydrology, oceanography, and coastal studies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This initial inland image is a tantalizing indication of how SWOT can measure details of smaller lakes, ponds, and rivers in ways that satellites could not before. Such data will be used to produce an extraordinary accounting of the freshwater on Earth&rsquo;s surface in ways useful to researchers, policymakers, and water resource managers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The KaRIn instrument took years to develop and build, and it will collect information on bodies of water across the globe &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-turns-to-the-cloud-for-help-with-next-generation-earth-missions\">data</a> that will be freely and openly available to everybody who needs it,&rdquo; said Parag Vaze, SWOT project manager at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>More About the Mission</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-launches-international-mission-to-survey-earths-water\">Launched</a> on Dec. 16, 2022, from Vandenberg Space Force Base in central California, SWOT is now in a period of commissioning, calibration, and validation. Engineers are checking out the performance of the satellite&rsquo;s systems and science instruments before the planned start of science operations in summer 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data for these first images was collected by SWOT&rsquo;s KaRIn instrument, the scientific heart of the satellite. KaRIn has one antenna at each end of a boom that&rsquo;s 33 feet (10 meters) long. This enables the instrument to look off to either side of a center line directly below the satellite as it bounces microwave signals off Earth&rsquo;s surface. The returning radar signals arrive at each antenna slightly out of sync, or phase, from one another. When these signals are combined with other information about the antennas and the satellite&rsquo;s altitude, scientists will be able to map the height of water on Earth&rsquo;s surface with never-before-seen clarity. KaRIn encountered an <a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/swot/2023/02/23/engineers-check-swot-science-instrument-during-commissioning-activities/\">issue</a> earlier this year with one of its subsystems; engineers have now <a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/swot/2023/03/17/swot-science-instrument-is-up-and-running-continues-with-commissioning/\">resolved the situation</a>, and the instrument is up and running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SWOT was jointly developed by NASA and CNES, with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and the UK Space Agency. JPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, leads the U.S. component of the project. For the flight system payload, NASA provided the KaRIn instrument, a GPS science receiver, a laser retroreflector, a two-beam microwave radiometer, and NASA instrument operations. CNES provided the Doppler Orbitography and Radioposition Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) system, the dual frequency Poseidon altimeter (developed by Thales Alenia Space), the KaRIn radio-frequency subsystem (together with Thales Alenia Space and with support from the UK Space Agency), the satellite platform, and ground operations. CSA provided the KaRIn high-power transmitter assembly. NASA provided the launch vehicle and the agency&rsquo;s Launch Services Program, based at Kennedy Space Center, managed the associated launch services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about SWOT, visit:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/\"><b>https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>News Media Contacts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Jane J.

Climate change is melting Earth&rsquo;s ice sheets and glaciers, adding more fresh water to the ocean, while warming causes the expansion of seawater. Both of these effects contribute to rising seas, overriding many natural effects on sea surface height.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Tracking the greenhouse gases that we add to the atmosphere tells us how hard we&rsquo;re pushing the climate, but sea levels show us how much it&rsquo;s responding,&rdquo; said Josh Willis, an oceanographer at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. &ldquo;These measurements are a critical yardstick for how much humans are reshaping the climate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>A Long-Term Record</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The measurements of sea surface height that began 30 years ago with TOPEX/Poseidon have continued through four subsequent missions led by NASA and partners, including the French space agency CNES, ESA (European Space Agency), and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/international-sea-level-satellite-takes-over-from-predecessor\">most recent mission</a> in the series, Sentinel-6/Jason-CS (Continuity of Service), consists of two satellites that will extend these measurements through 2030. The <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sentinel-6\">first of these two satellites</a>, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, launched in 2020, with the second slated to head to orbit in 2025.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The 30-year satellite record allows us to see through the shorter-term shifts that happen naturally in the ocean and helps us identify the trends that tell us where sea level is headed,&rdquo; said JPL&rsquo;s Ben Hamlington, a sea level researcher who leads NASA&rsquo;s Sea Level Change science team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientific and technical innovations by NASA and other space agencies have given researchers a better understanding of the current state of the ocean on a global scale. Specifically, <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147435/taking-a-measure-of-sea-level-rise-ocean-altimetry\">radar altimeters</a> have helped produce ever-more precise measurements of sea level around the world. To calculate sea level height, they bounce microwave signals off the ocean&rsquo;s surface and record the time the signal takes to travel from a satellite to Earth and back, as well as the strength of the return signal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When altimetry data from all ocean basins is combined with more than a century of observations from coastal surface-based sources, together they dramatically expand and improve our understanding of how sea surface height is changing on a global scale. And when those measurements of sea level are combined with other NASA data sets on ice mass, land motion, and other Earth changes, scientists can decipher why and how seas are rising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn more about sea level and climate change:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://sealevel.nasa.gov/\"><b>https://sealevel.nasa.gov/</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>News Media Contacts</h2>\r\n\r\n<div>Jane J.

Bottom-up carbon inventories are critical for assessing progress toward emission-reduction efforts, but compiling them requires considerable resources, expertise, and knowledge of the extent of the relevant activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why developing a database of emissions and removals via a top-down approach could be especially helpful for nations that lack traditional resources for inventory development, the study authors assert. In fact, the scientists&rsquo; findings include data for more than 50 countries that have not reported emissions for at least the past 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study provides a new perspective by tracking both fossil fuel emissions and the total carbon &ldquo;stock&rdquo; changes in ecosystems, including trees, shrubs, and soils. The data is particularly useful for tracking carbon dioxide fluctuations related to land cover change. Emissions from deforestation alone make up a disproportionate amount of total carbon output in the Global South, which encompasses regions of Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. In other parts of the world, the findings indicate some reductions in atmospheric carbon concentrations via improved land stewardship and reforestation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors said that bottom-up methods for estimating carbon dioxide emissions and removals from ecosystems are essential. However, those methods are vulnerable to uncertainty when data is lacking or the net effects of specific activities, such as logging, aren&rsquo;t fully known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our top-down estimates provide an independent estimate of these emissions and removals, so although they cannot replace the detailed process understanding of traditional bottom-up methods, we can check both approaches for consistency,&rdquo; said Philippe Ciais, a study author and research director at the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l&rsquo;Environnement in France.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure class='embedded_video video_player_container column-width'>\n<div class='video_wrapper'>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NsOiUHsW2wY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\nThis map illustrates changes in the amount of carbon stored in organic matter on land, called terrestrial carbon stock changes, from 2015 to 2020.

Both processes will increase the concentration of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and drive climate change. Therefore, it is critical to monitor the carbon balance of unmanaged ecosystems and identify any changes in carbon uptake.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking forward, the researchers said their pilot project can be further refined to understand how emissions from individual nations are changing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sustained, high-quality observations are critical for these top-down estimates,&rdquo; said lead author Brendan Byrne, a scientist at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. &ldquo;Continued observations from OCO-2 and surface sites will allow us to track how these emissions and removals change as the Paris Agreement is implemented. Future international missions that provide expanded mapping of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations across the globe will allow us to refine these top-down estimates and give more precise estimates of countries&rsquo; emissions and removals.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched in 2014, the OCO-2 satellite maps natural and human-made <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/earth-now/#/vitalsign?vitalsign=carbon_dioxide&altid=0&animating=f&start=&end=\">carbon dioxide concentrations</a> with the help of three camera-like spectrometers.

For at least 60 years, growers have been pumping more water from aquifers than can be replenished by natural sources, causing the <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-finds-new-way-to-monitor-underground-water-loss\">ground level to sink</a> and requiring wells to be drilled deeper and deeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As water grows more scarce in the Central Valley due to climate change and human use, a more detailed understanding of the natural movement of groundwater offers a chance to better protect the remaining resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<section class='newsletter_cta_module' style='background-color: #F2F6FF'>\n<div class='newsletter_cta_inner_wrapper'>\n<div class='module_title'>\nGet NASA's Climate Change News\n</div>\n<div class='email_field_container'>\n<form action='/newsletter_signup/' class='body_form'>\n<input class='email_field' name='newsletter_subscribe_email' placeholder='enter email address' type='email'>\n<button class='email_submit' onMouseOut='this.style.color='#396AA2'' onMouseOver='this.style.color='#48A1C0'' style='color: #396AA2'>\n<svg height=\"100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 26 20\" width=\"100%\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"m60.5879081 230.937543c.0854372-.049231.1936357-.033361.2609299.038219l8.1980135 8.67638c.0573979.060243.0725721.148018.038925.22316-.0329873.075791-.1088582.124698-.1929759.124698h-23.4714813c-.1398664 0-.2774236-.039191-.4199289-.121459-.0577278-.032713-.096323-.091013-.1035802-.156115s.0171534-.129556.0659747-.174253l9.163223-8.345364c.0672942-.061539.1679056-.072227.2477349-.027854l2.4130239 1.353538c.3239356.180731.7362774.179112 1.0582338-.006801zm9.098032-5.453759c.0654834-.037926.1449758-.039575.2101334-.001319.0645061.037595.1039265.107181.1039265.183032v11.396496c0 .087064-.0521261.164564-.1319443.196553-.0244341.009234-.0504971.014181-.0762344.014181-.0573388 0-.1120712-.023415-.1521431-.067277l-6.7568492-7.373077c-.0420266-.0465-.0615739-.110809-.0534292-.173799.009122-.063319.0465877-.119383.1006685-.151043zm-25.5752757-.001316c.0693403-.036687.1551402-.037331.2230798-.001287l7.6225345 4.000908c.0616359.032826.1036603.090432.1113648.15544.0077045.064687-.0185608.129695-.0710914.173785l-7.6207835 6.497291c-.0420244.036044-.0970064.055031-.1519884.055031-.0308179 0-.0612857-.005792-.0900024-.0177-.0812472-.032504-.1337778-.106523-.1337778-.187945v-10.497876c0-.073054.0420244-.140959.1106644-.177647zm25.0262707-5.482468c.4761039 0 .8630649.382512.8630649.852398v1.534382c0 .101048-.0864416.152071-.1701818.208431-.0692208.046689-.2535844.148069-.3231429.18642l-12.3732987 7.189022c-.0334285.019676-.0715844.029347-.1094026.029347-.0371428 0-.0742857-.008671-.1073766-.02768l-12.7589091-7.197692c-.0709091-.036684-.1576883-.127393-.1576883-.20643v-1.715467c0-.470219.386961-.852731.8630649-.852731z\" fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" transform=\"translate(-44 -220)\"/></svg>\n</button>\n</form>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\r\n\r\n<p>In the recently published study led by scientist Donald Argus of NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, researchers found that groundwater volume fluctuates more widely between dry and wet years than had been previously understood. In particular, the scientists observed a greater loss of groundwater during dry years than earlier studies had estimated. Argus and colleagues estimated that the Central Valley lost about 1.8 million acre feet (2.2 cubic kilometers) of groundwater per year between 2006 to 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no way to directly measure the total volume of water on and under the Central Valley, but the satellites of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE FO) missions can accurately measure how much that volume changes from month to month. Argus and colleagues have been working for several years to combine such GRACE data with observations from a GPS research network that measures how land surfaces rise and subside. In central California, those motions are largely caused by increases and decreases in underground water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Argus <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/sierras-lost-water-weight-grew-taller-during-drought\">had previously used GPS</a> to quantify the changing volume of water deep within the Sierra. For this new study, he and his co-authors used both GPS and GRACE measurements and subtracted the mountain groundwater change from the groundwater changes in both the mountains and the valley to obtain a more accurate estimate of change in the valley alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then they compared that number with an estimate that co-author Sarfaraz Alam, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University, had calculated using a water-balance model. Such models attempt to account for all water entering and leaving an area from all processes, including river flows, precipitation, evaporation, and pumping from wells. The difference between the model&rsquo;s estimate and their new result, they believe, must come from the one process that was not included in the water-balance model: groundwater flowing from the mountains into the valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The volume of the inflow was surprising, according to Argus, because researchers believed they already had a good understanding of the amount of water entering and leaving the Central Valley. &ldquo;We now know how much groundwater is going into and coming out of the aquifers during each season of the year, and during periods of drought and episodes of heavy precipitation,&rdquo; Argus said. This new understanding could be used, for example, to modify existing restrictions on watering during dry years versus wet years to better match usage with the available groundwater resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>News Media Contacts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Jane J.

Continuing the planet's long-term warming trend, global temperatures in 2022 were 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.89 degrees Celsius) above the average for NASA's baseline period (1951-1980), scientists from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This warming trend is alarming,&rdquo; said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. &ldquo;Our warming climate is already making a mark: Forest fires are intensifying; hurricanes are getting stronger; droughts are wreaking havoc and sea levels are rising. NASA is deepening our commitment to do our part in addressing climate change. Our Earth System Observatory will provide state-of-the-art data to support our climate modeling, analysis and predictions to help humanity confront our planet&rsquo;s changing climate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.

Recently, NASA scientists, as well as international scientists, determined carbon dioxide emissions were the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-4811-2022\">highest on record</a> in 2022. NASA also identified some <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/methane-super-emitters-mapped-by-nasas-new-earth-space-mission\">super-emitters</a> of methane &ndash; another powerful greenhouse gas &ndash; using the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation instrument that launched to the International Space Station last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Arctic region continues to experience the strongest warming trends &ndash; close to four times the global average &ndash; according to <a href=\"https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1195179\">GISS research</a> presented at the 2022 annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union, as well as a separate <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3\">study</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Communities around the world are experiencing impacts scientists see as connected to the warming atmosphere and ocean. Climate change has intensified rainfall and tropical storms, deepened the severity of droughts, and increased the impact of storm surges. Last year brought <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150470/flood-woes-continue-in-pakistan\">torrential monsoon </a>rains that devastated Pakistan and a persistent <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01290-z\">megadrought</a> in the U.S. Southwest. In September, <a href=\"https://gpm.nasa.gov/applications/hurricane-ian-forms-south-cuba\">Hurricane Ian</a> became one of the strongest and costliest hurricanes to strike the continental U.S.  </p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Tracking Our Changing Planet</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>NASA&rsquo;s global temperature analysis is drawn from data collected by weather stations and Antarctic research stations, as well as instruments mounted on ships and ocean buoys. NASA scientists analyze these measurements to account for uncertainties in the data and to maintain consistent methods for calculating global average surface temperature differences for every year. These ground-based measurements of surface temperature are consistent with satellite data collected since 2002 by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder on NASA's Aqua satellite and with other estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NASA uses the period from 1951-1980 as a baseline to understand how global temperatures change over time. That baseline includes climate patterns such as La Ni&ntilde;a and El Ni&ntilde;o, as well as unusually hot or cold years due to other factors, ensuring it encompasses natural variations in Earth's temperature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many factors can affect the average temperature in any given year. For example, 2022 was one of the warmest on record despite a third consecutive year of La Ni&ntilde;a conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean. NASA scientists estimate that La Ni&ntilde;a&rsquo;s cooling influence may have lowered global temperatures slightly (about 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit or 0.06 degrees Celsius) from what the average would have been under more typical ocean conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A separate, <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/global-climate-202212\">independent analysis</a> by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) concluded that the global surface temperature for 2022 was the sixth highest since 1880. NOAA scientists use much of the same raw temperature data in their analysis and have a different baseline period (1901-2000) and methodology. Although rankings for specific years can differ slightly between the records, they are in broad agreement and both reflect ongoing long-term warming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NASA's <a href=\"https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/\">full dataset of global surface temperatures</a> through 2022, as well as full details with code of how NASA scientists conducted the analysis, are publicly available from GISS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GISS is a NASA laboratory managed by the Earth Sciences Division of the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

Analyzing the plant&rsquo;s emission plumes from several satellite overpasses between 2017 and 2022, they detected changes in carbon dioxide levels that were consistent with hourly fluctuations in electricity generation. Temporary and permanent unit shutdowns (for maintenance or decommissioning) reduced the plant&rsquo;s overall emissions, which the team was able to detect as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The findings demonstrate that space-based observations can be used to track carbon dioxide emission changes at a local scale, the scientists said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module column-width' style='width:px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='' href='https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/pia18374-oco-2-e1-1041.jpg' target='_blank'>\n<picture>\n<img alt='This illustration shows NASA’s OCO-2 satellite, launched in 2014' src='https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/pia18374-oco-2-e1-1041.jpg?itok=LH9jG8kO' style='width:px'>\n</picture>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nThis illustration shows NASA&rsquo;s OCO-2 satellite, launched in 2014.

Bełchat&oacute;w Power Station, in operation since 1988, is the largest lignite-fired power plant in the world, with a reported capacity of 5,102 megawatts. Lignite (brown coal) typically leads to higher emissions per megawatt generated than anthracite (hard coal). The Polish government has drafted plans to close the plant by the end of 2036.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ray Nassar, a senior researcher at Environment and Climate Change Canada and the study&rsquo;s lead author, noted that most carbon dioxide emissions reports are created from estimates or data collected at the land surface. Researchers account for the mass of fossil fuels purchased and used, then calculate the expected emissions; they generally do not make actual atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The finer details about exactly when and where emissions occur are often not available,&rdquo; Nassar said. &ldquo;Providing a more detailed picture of carbon dioxide emissions could help to track the effectiveness of policies to reduce emissions. Our approach with OCO-2 and OCO-3 can be applied to more power plants or modified for carbon dioxide emissions from cities or countries.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the mapping mode observations of OCO-3, NASA data could be used more extensively in quantifying CO<sub>2</sub> point-source emissions in the future. NASA recently announced that mission operations will be extended for several more years aboard the space station, and the instrument will operate alongside another greenhouse gas observer aboard the space station, the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (<a href=\"https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/\">EMIT</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is really exciting to think that we will get another five to six years of operations with OCO-3,&rdquo; Chatterjee said. &ldquo;We are seeing that making measurements at the right time and at the right scale is critical.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added that OCO-3 can serve as a &ldquo;pathfinder&rdquo; for next-generation satellite missions. The OCO-2 and OCO-3 projects are managed by JPL. Caltech manages JPL for NASA.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>News Media Contacts</h2>\r\n\r\n<div>Jane J.

The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) spacecraft also has contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and the UK Space Agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) spacecraft launched atop a SpaceX rocket from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California with a prime mission of three years. The satellite will measure the height of water in freshwater bodies and the ocean on more than 90% of Earth&rsquo;s surface. This information will provide insights into how the ocean influences climate change; how a warming world affects lakes, rivers, and reservoirs; and how communities can better prepare for disasters, such as floods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After SWOT separated from the second stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, ground controllers successfully acquired the satellite&rsquo;s signal. Initial telemetry reports showed the spacecraft in good health.

The scientific heart of the spacecraft is an innovative instrument called the Ka-band radar interferometer (<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/latest-international-water-satellite-packs-an-engineering-punch\">KaRIn</a>), which marks a major technological advance. KaRIn bounces radar pulses off the water&rsquo;s surface and receives the return signal using two antennas on either side of the spacecraft. This arrangement &ndash; one signal, two antennas &ndash; will enable engineers to precisely determine the height of the water&rsquo;s surface across two swaths at a time, each of them 30 miles (50 kilometers) wide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re eager to see SWOT in action,&rdquo; said Karen St. Germain, NASA Earth Science Division director. &ldquo;This satellite embodies how we are improving life on Earth through science and technological innovations. The data that innovation will provide is essential to better understanding how Earth&rsquo;s air, water, and ecosystems interact &ndash; and how people can thrive on our changing planet.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the many benefits the SWOT mission will provide is a significantly clearer picture of Earth&rsquo;s freshwater bodies. It will provide data on more than 95% of the world&rsquo;s lakes larger than 15 acres (62,500 square meters) and rivers wider than 330 feet (100 meters) across. Currently, freshwater researchers have reliable measurements for only a few thousand lakes around the world. SWOT will push that number into the millions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the coast, SWOT will provide information on sea level, filling in observational gaps in areas that don&rsquo;t have tide gauges or other instruments that measure sea surface height. Over time, that data can help researchers better track sea level rise, which will directly impact communities and coastal ecosystems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such an ambitious mission is possible because of NASA&rsquo;s long-standing commitment to working with agencies around the world to study Earth and its climate. NASA and CNES have built upon a decades-long relationship that started in the 1980s to monitor Earth&rsquo;s oceans. This collaboration pioneered the use of a space-based instrument called an altimeter to study sea level with the launch of the <a href=\"https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/topex-poseidon/summary/\">TOPEX/Poseidon</a> satellite in 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This mission marks the continuity of 30 years of collaboration between NASA and CNES in altimetry,&rdquo; said Caroline Laurent, CNES Orbital Systems and Applications director. &ldquo;It shows how international collaboration can be achieved through a breakthrough mission that will help us better understand climate change and its effects around the world.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SWOT measurements will also help researchers, policymakers, and resource managers better assess and plan for things, including floods and droughts. By providing information on where the water is &ndash; where it&rsquo;s coming from and where it&rsquo;s going &ndash; researchers can improve flood projections for rivers and monitor drought effects on lakes and reservoirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;SWOT will provide vital information, given the urgent challenges posed by climate change and sea level rise,&rdquo; said Laurie Leshin, NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory director. JPL developed the KaRIn instrument and manages the U.S. portion of the mission. &ldquo;That SWOT will fill gaps in our knowledge and inform future action is the direct result of commitment, innovation, and collaboration going back many years. We&rsquo;re excited to get SWOT science underway.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>More Mission Information</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>JPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, leads the U.S. component of the project.

The multiyear effort is being developed and conducted by the nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.carbonmapper.org/\">Carbon Mapper</a> organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, the source of roughly a quarter to a third of global warming caused by humans. The aim of the new initiative is to establish a baseline assessment of global waste sites that emit methane at high rates. This information can support decision-makers as they work to reduce the concentration of the gas in the atmosphere and limit climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Methane produced by the waste sector contributes an estimated 20% of human-caused methane emissions. Ton for ton, methane is more than 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat in the atmosphere. But where carbon dioxide remains in the air for centuries, methane has an atmospheric lifetime of only about a decade or two. That means some immediate slowing of atmospheric warming could be achieved if methane emissions were significantly reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<section class='newsletter_cta_module' style='background-color: #F2F6FF'>\n<div class='newsletter_cta_inner_wrapper'>\n<div class='module_title'>\nGet NASA's Climate Change News\n</div>\n<div class='email_field_container'>\n<form action='/newsletter_signup/' class='body_form'>\n<input class='email_field' name='newsletter_subscribe_email' placeholder='enter email address' type='email'>\n<button class='email_submit' onMouseOut='this.style.color='#396AA2'' onMouseOver='this.style.color='#48A1C0'' style='color: #396AA2'>\n<svg height=\"100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 26 20\" width=\"100%\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"m60.5879081 230.937543c.0854372-.049231.1936357-.033361.2609299.038219l8.1980135 8.67638c.0573979.060243.0725721.148018.038925.22316-.0329873.075791-.1088582.124698-.1929759.124698h-23.4714813c-.1398664 0-.2774236-.039191-.4199289-.121459-.0577278-.032713-.096323-.091013-.1035802-.156115s.0171534-.129556.0659747-.174253l9.163223-8.345364c.0672942-.061539.1679056-.072227.2477349-.027854l2.4130239 1.353538c.3239356.180731.7362774.179112 1.0582338-.006801zm9.098032-5.453759c.0654834-.037926.1449758-.039575.2101334-.001319.0645061.037595.1039265.107181.1039265.183032v11.396496c0 .087064-.0521261.164564-.1319443.196553-.0244341.009234-.0504971.014181-.0762344.014181-.0573388 0-.1120712-.023415-.1521431-.067277l-6.7568492-7.373077c-.0420266-.0465-.0615739-.110809-.0534292-.173799.009122-.063319.0465877-.119383.1006685-.151043zm-25.5752757-.001316c.0693403-.036687.1551402-.037331.2230798-.001287l7.6225345 4.000908c.0616359.032826.1036603.090432.1113648.15544.0077045.064687-.0185608.129695-.0710914.173785l-7.6207835 6.497291c-.0420244.036044-.0970064.055031-.1519884.055031-.0308179 0-.0612857-.005792-.0900024-.0177-.0812472-.032504-.1337778-.106523-.1337778-.187945v-10.497876c0-.073054.0420244-.140959.1106644-.177647zm25.0262707-5.482468c.4761039 0 .8630649.382512.8630649.852398v1.534382c0 .101048-.0864416.152071-.1701818.208431-.0692208.046689-.2535844.148069-.3231429.18642l-12.3732987 7.189022c-.0334285.019676-.0715844.029347-.1094026.029347-.0371428 0-.0742857-.008671-.1073766-.02768l-12.7589091-7.197692c-.0709091-.036684-.1576883-.127393-.1576883-.20643v-1.715467c0-.470219.386961-.852731.8630649-.852731z\" fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" transform=\"translate(-44 -220)\"/></svg>\n</button>\n</form>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Currently, there is limited actionable information about methane emissions from the global waste sector. A comprehensive understanding of high-emission point sources from waste sites is a critical step to mitigating them,&rdquo; said Carbon Mapper CEO Riley Duren. &ldquo;New technological capabilities that are making these emissions visible &ndash; and therefore actionable &ndash; have the potential to change the game, elevating our collective understanding of near-term opportunities in this often overlooked sector.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carbon Mapper received a grant from the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment to support its operations related to the waste-site initiative, including potential funding to cover airborne methane surveys using NASA airborne assets. The project will entail conducting an initial remote-sensing survey in 2023 of more than 1,000 managed landfills across the United States and Canada, and in key locations in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. To collect data from these regions, researchers will use aircraft-based sensors, including the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (<a href=\"https://avirisng.jpl.nasa.gov/\">AVIRIS-NG</a>), which was developed at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. In addition, they will use Arizona State University&rsquo;s Global Airborne Observatory from the Center of Global Discovery and Conservation Science, which uses another JPL-built imaging spectrometer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the Carbon Mapper project, researchers will analyze methane data from EMIT as well. The JPL-managed imaging spectrometer was installed on the International Space Station in July 2022 to measure the mineral content at the surface of Earth&rsquo;s major dust-producing regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October, scientists demonstrated that EMIT can also <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3228/methane-super-emitters-mapped-by-nasas-new-earth-space-mission/\">identify methane plumes</a> from &ldquo;super-emitters.&rdquo; In so doing, the team added another tool to help with NASA&rsquo;s broader efforts to monitor greenhouse gases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;NASA JPL has a decadelong track record of using airborne imaging spectrometers to make high-quality observations of methane point-source emissions,&rdquo; said Robert Green, EMIT&rsquo;s principal investigator at JPL. &ldquo;With EMIT we have employed the same technology in a spaceborne instrument, enabling us to collect information on localized methane sources from orbit.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the first year of the Carbon Mapper project, researchers will conduct a broader survey of more than 10,000 landfills around the world using two satellites in the Carbon Mapper satellite program. The pair of spacecraft will be equipped with imaging spectrometer technology developed at JPL. The team is targeting a launch in late 2023 in coordination with Planet Labs PBC, among other partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data from the project will be accessible at the <a href=\"https://carbonmapper.org/data/\">Carbon Mapper Data Portal</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For additional details about EMIT, visit:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/\"><b>https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>More About the Missions</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>EMIT was selected from the Earth Venture Instrument-4 solicitation under the Earth Science Division of NASA&rsquo;s Science Mission Directorate and was developed at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed for the agency by Caltech in Pasadena, California. The instrument&rsquo;s data will be delivered to the <a href=\"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/\">NASA Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center</a> (DAAC) for use by other researchers and the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) was built at JPL and designed to measure wavelengths of light from 380 to 2,510 nanometers. It has flown numerous missions, studying phenomena such as plant ecology, mineralogy, snow and ice hydrology, and environmental hazards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carbon Mapper is a nonprofit organization focused on facilitating timely action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Its mission is to fill gaps in the emerging global ecosystem of methane and carbon dioxide monitoring systems by delivering data at facility scale that is precise, timely, and accessible to empower science-based decision making and action. The organization is leading the development of the Carbon Mapper constellation of satellites supported by a public-private partnership composed of Planet Labs PBC, JPL, the California Air Resources Board, the University of Arizona, Arizona State University, and RMI, with funding from High Tide Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, and other philanthropic donors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>News Media Contacts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew Wang / Jane J.

KaRIn will measure the height of water in the ocean, &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; features like currents and eddies that are less than 13 miles (20 kilometers) across &ndash; up to 10 times smaller than those detectable with other sea level satellites.

Researchers then have to extrapolate if they want a broader idea of what&rsquo;s happening in a water body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KaRIn is different.

As a result, it can take measurements regardless of weather or time of day. The instrument configuration consists of one antenna at each end of a boom that&rsquo;s 33 feet (10 meters) long. By bouncing radar pulses off the water&rsquo;s surface and receiving the return signal with both antennas, KaRIn will collect data along a swath 30 miles (50 kilometers) wide on either side of the satellite. &ldquo;With KaRIn data, we&rsquo;ll be able to actually see what&rsquo;s happening, rather than relying on these extrapolations,&rdquo; said Tamlin Pavelsky, the NASA freshwater science lead for SWOT, based at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure class='embedded_video video_player_container column-width'>\n<div class='video_wrapper'>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTlPEWxOU38\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\nThis animation shows the two antennas for SWOT&rsquo;s Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) instrument unfolding in orbit.

Using this phase difference, the distance between the two antennas, and the radar wavelength, researchers can calculate the height of the water that KaRIn is looking at.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Breakthrough Technology</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a remarkable instrument demanded a lot from the team that developed it. For starters, there was the need for stability. &ldquo;You have two antennas looking at the same spot on the ground, but if their footprints don&rsquo;t overlap, you won&rsquo;t see anything,&rdquo; said Esteban-Fernandez. That was one of the many technical challenges the mission faced in creating KaRIn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Engineers also need to know exactly how SWOT is positioned in space to ensure the accuracy of KaRIn&rsquo;s data. If researchers don&rsquo;t know the spacecraft is tilted, for instance, they can&rsquo;t account for that in their calculations. &ldquo;Imagine that the boom rolls because the spacecraft moves, so one antenna is slightly higher than the other,&rdquo; Esteban-Fernandez said. &ldquo;That will skew the results &ndash; it&rsquo;ll look like all your water is on a slope.&rdquo; So engineers included a high-performance gyroscope on the satellite to account for shifts in SWOT&rsquo;s position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Engineers designing KaRIn also had to contend with the amount of radar power transmitted. &ldquo;To measure things down to centimeter accuracy, you need to transmit radar pulses of 1.5 kilowatts, which is a huge amount of power for a satellite like this,&rdquo; said Esteban-Fernandez. &ldquo;In order to generate that, you have to have tens of thousands of volts operating on the satellite.&rdquo; The engineers needed to use designs and materials specific to high-voltage systems when manufacturing the electronics to help the satellite accommodate such high-power and high-voltage needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team spent years overcoming those and a multitude of other challenges to deliver the KaRIn instrument. Very soon the interferometer will fly for the first time on the SWOT satellite and start sending back terabytes of data. &ldquo;KaRIn will be putting something on the table that just didn&rsquo;t exist before,&rdquo; said Esteban-Fernandez.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>More About the Mission</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Scheduled to launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base in Central California on Dec. 15, SWOT is being jointly developed by NASA and CNES, with contributions from the CSA and the UK Space Agency. JPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, leads the U.S. component of the project. For the flight system payload, NASA is providing the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) instrument, a GPS science receiver, a laser retroreflector, a two-beam microwave radiometer, and NASA instrument operations. CNES is providing the Doppler Orbitography and Radioposition Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) system, the dual frequency Poseidon altimeter (developed by Thales Alenia Space), the KaRIn radio-frequency subsystem (together with Thales Alenia Space and with support from the UK Space Agency), the satellite platform, and ground control segment. CSA is providing the KaRIn high-power transmitter assembly. NASA is providing the launch vehicle and associated launch services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about SWOT, visit:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/\"><b>https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>News Media Contacts</h2>\r\n\r\n<div>Jane J.
